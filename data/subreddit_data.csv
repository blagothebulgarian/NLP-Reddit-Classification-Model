0,Careers with a BS in Mechanical Engineering,1,60,210,1638995117,"careers with a bs in mechanical engineering hi all.

so yes, i graduated this year with a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering but know for a fact i do not want to be an engineer and i couldn’t be more uninterested in the work. i know it sounds dumb, but i started the degree because everyone said i would probably be good at it because of my math skills, so i went to college for me. realized that it wasn’t interesting whatsoever, however i finished the degree because it seems to have versatility and it would be dumb to throw away money for classes and then just drop out…

so my question is, how many of you have gotten engineering degrees but didn’t become engineers and went into a completely different field? if so, what field/what do you do?
 
thanks!!",43,726,7,132
0,Am I really an engineer?,1,19,59,1638988318,"am i really an engineer? let me first explain my situation. the official title of the role i'm currently working in is mechanical design engineer. i have around one year of experience in this role. i don't think i'm actually working as an engineer. my tasks are basically creating 3d models of pressure vessels/parts of steam boilers/auxiliary structures and generating drawings for manufacturing from those models. when my department gets a new project, engineers do the calculations and dimension the product. then they make a quick sketch using an autocad drawing of a similar product my company was working on before. this sketch serves as a base for my model and drawings for manufacturing. when i was first interviewing with my company, i was told that i would later become involved with strength/ thermodynamic calculations but i have seen none of this. i do what i did the first day of my employment here. i create 3d models and drawings in autodesk inventor from someone's sketches created in autocad. my only task regarding the design is to adapt some auxiliary platform/railing to the client's requirements. when i ask my superiors when will i be given higher-level tasks, they basically say that we currently don't have time for that and just rush me to generate more production drawings. sometimes there isn't that much modeling and drawing work and i could be assigned a mentor. when that time finally comes, they give us some non-engineering jobs. for example, taking the inventory. 

am i wrong to think that this isn't the only thing an engineer should be working on? i didn't go to university for this. at the university, i did strength/thermal/fluid calculations and now i am drawing lines and circles all day. 

what should i do? is it in other companies also that hard to get engineering tasks? does this employment mean something for me in sense of getting further engineering jobs? do i try to persuade my superiors to give me real engineering jobs or do i start looking elseware?

just to add, i am not in the usa. i am in a small south european country.

the second part of my question is how to pitch my reason for leaving to my next employer. part of it is that i've just been burned out for months, and i don't see it any better. aforementioned project manager has been here for 3 months, and he seems like he's already burned out. the less political reason is that it's a long commute, and they switched us to a 4x10 schedule, so i'm typically spending 13+ hours out of the house for work.

even since day one, i haven’t been given a lot of guidance/mentorship. they just kinda threw me into the mix and “said” (conveyed) “welcome to the company. do work. good luck!”

the thing is that the person instigating my removal is an old crotchety director of manufacturing who is well past retiring age and has zero to no tolerance for others, you know the type. we'll call him the big e. my boss said that the big e asked if i could be cut loose back in february of this year but my boss asked if they could keep me for a while longer since i had literally just started working for him (my old boss moved on to greener pastures).

now comes the fun part. my boss is also looking for another job and he is kind of spastic so he decided that it is time for me to also leave. he approached the big e on monday and said he would like to cut me loose but give me some time to find another gig. his words to me today were ""this isn't a place for you, you are not meant to work here"". he's honestly right, this place is running equipment from decades ago and has been in a firefighting culture since i started. they flushed out a bunch of the old backwards management which hired me and are trying to do a 180 back into the right direction. i probably can't count on both hands the number of people i've seen leave in the past few months, people i've been close with.

regardless, i have months to find a new job and to make matters more interesting, i bought a house a year ago, and am getting married in 10 days. talk about a cluster of life changes. i am expecting to get called into the big e's office tomorrow morning (that is when my boss will tell him we talked), and have already been told i need to be appreciative of the chance to work a little while longer while looking for a new job. that part is obvious, but how should i play my cards going forward?

i've tried copper tinsel to reduce static, i've tried riffling the paper in a fan to eliminate humidity, i've tried taping a brush to the side of the stack to increase friction between the pages, also tried velcro, i've tried magnets in a sort of rube goldberg contraption, nothing works.

it's ok for me to use programming as a tool, like ""oh shit, this task is gonna take so long to do by hands, let me automate it with a python script"". ""oh man, this project is impossible to draw by hands, let me use cad"". but beyond that i just don't think it makes sense. like people getting in ee and after going full cs.

like me, for example, i want to get into electrical power engineering - substations, electrical installations, atmospheric exhaust protective systems, control and protection and all that stuff. and always i gotta hear someone shout ""learn arduino"", ""learn software development"", like dude, wtf does it have to do?

i'm sorry for my little rant, i just wanted to share that, i hope you guys feel free to add to the discussion here.",44,1758,6,319

it's a good career but i've always been more passionate about physics and engineering. during college i was considering doing mechanical engineering since i enjoyed my physics classes way more than any of my cs classes, but i had already gotten a cs internship and thought i had too much momentum in cs to switch.

i know that i will likely not be making as much money as i do in software, so this is more of a passion move than a financial one. i'm also an intense saver so i'm in a position where i can take a couple years off of work for schooling.

some background: i'm a grade 12 student who applied to various engineering, general science, and health science programs (canada) and am quite conflicted. 

i love studying maths and sciences (especially physics!!) and enjoy solving problems. sounds like i could be a potential engineer-human, right?

**my dilemma:** i'm quite creative, and don't have that ""technical"" way of thinking that every engineer i know has (unless this is just imposter syndrome...). i was never interested in trains, cars, tools, or computers when i was little, and have never taken part in robotics clubs or coding clubs. instead i spend my free time playing sports, music, photography, etc. and am involved in similar clubs/teams at school. **is this a sign that i shouldn't pursue engineering?** i feel like i don't have the same interests “typical” engineers have and see so many posts here of people struggling in their programs which is making me worried.

i guess i just want to know if other people had similar worries going into engineering and ended up loving it, hating it, or regretting it.

i do get to do a fair amount of field work and traveling which i actually enjoy for the most part, but the office work and bs politics makes me want to drive off of a cliff sometimes. it gets so bad that i get awful chest pain almost every day from it, and i'm only in my 20s and in good shape.


here are some of the cons... sorry for the long rant but i've been holding this in for years.


we get our hours cut on every single project to maximize our profit and to have a chance at winning the job, so that leaves me with barely any hours for a very complex task. 


if i go over budget i'll get a nasty email from the pm, so i end up having to work for free, use my vacation hours, or charge to overhead to get the job done. if i charge to overhead i get yelled at by my manager, and if my billability drops below 80% i'll be fired, but they pretty much expect you to be near 100% billable. 


we have a million upper management level people pulling in $200k+ that are completely on overhead and contribute nothing. but god forbid the guy making less than $80k per year charges a few overhead hours due to lack of work, which is out of my control, people go nuts.


half the time i have nothing to do except crappy monkey work that any idiot can do. nobody wants to share any of the real work because budgets are so tight. and every job is a copy/paste from the last one because there's not enough budget to actually design stuff. 


and many of the senior engineers i see are working 60+ hour weeks. they complain how they are so busy, yet when i offer my assistance so i can be billable, they act as if i'm not able to help because they want to hog all of the billable work for themselves. not everybody is like that, but a lot are. and they can't even charge most of those hours because they make too much money to charge to the project. plus my company now has a no overtime policy for most employees.


i'm working on getting my pe, but i'm not sure how much longer i can last as a consultant. i'm trying to figure out another route to take as an ee. i mostly work on power and controls type of work when i actually get work. 


i need something less stressful than consulting though, something less profit orientated. i don't even care about the money as long as it's a decent living. they say consulting is where the money is at, but it's drained the life out of me so much that i don't even care about making a lot of money. and the money is only good if you hop companies every few years which i have no interest in doing.


i don't want people calling me the night before and telling me i need to be in xx state across the country tomorrow morning. i don't want to have anxiety every time i'm trying to fill out my timesheet at the end of the week because i don't have enough work to fill it or am worried about budgets for the jobs i am working. 


i don't want to get another email from the jerkoff pm on a job i'm working on questioning every hour i work on the damn thing when i've had to use weeks of my vacation time to work on his stupid project that he didn't budget properly for. 


i need something low stress but with consistent work. i need something where i wont be worried about getting fired if i'm not busy. i need something less competitive and profit orientated. i'm thinking about maybe an electric utility company, or maybe a municipality of some sort, or maybe the department of transportation. most likely something public, not profit driven.


this isn't even really a question, more of a rant. i've had this on my chest for awhile and just needed to vent a bit. i need to get my pe before i do anything, but soon after i need to find a different career path because i'm going to end up in an early grave if i keep this job any longer. i don't think this is against the rules based on my reading of them, but feel free to remove if not allowed.


tl;dr
consulting sucks because there's never enough hours for anything due to low budgets, project managers are jerks, company values profit over it's employees, nobody wants to share work because they need billability, my work is constantly being questioned, and i have to work a lot of free hours or use my vacation time to work when budgets are shot. oh and the benefits suck. looking for another career option with less stress. i'm a good engineer, i just can't take the competitive profit driven nature of consulting.


edit:
thank you everybody for the kind words of advice. i read every single reply and every single one was positive. i also had a bunch of people reach out to me privately with words of encouragement. i think i understand what i need to do from here. i know i'm a good engineer, i'm just not being utilized properly and work for a very toxic company with a manager who never stands up for me. it's the only company i've ever worked for, so i somewhat assumed everywhere was like this, but this is clearly not the case. i never thought this post would blow up like it did, i was really just venting my feelings because i wanted somebody to hear me after holding this crap in for years. i appreciate all of you.",55,5425,11,1032
0,Can you hurt your career by being promoted too early?,1,472,194,1614773249,"can you hurt your career by being promoted too early? *note: i work in the defense industry so i'm being intentionally vague so as to not dox myself and to maintain opsec*

bluf/tl;dr: was offered a promotion that is far above my experience level. can you hurt your career by being promoted too early?

background: so two years ago i was hired by a large company in the defense industry as an entry level engineer on the sustainment side. basically making sure the components from decades ago still work and such. as far as jobs go it's pretty non linear as when nothing is wrong i'm sitting around doing nothing, while i work overtime when we discover an issue that needs resolving.

the team i was hired on to is very... experienced. my hire probably dropped the average age by 25 years. with that, nobody on the team is tech savvy, including our 70+ year old technology subject matter expert (important later). we have licenses for all the most recent software like matlab, ansys etc but nobody on the team knows how to use it, or even learn via youtube/google so 99% of the work is done in excel or access. when i got hired i started doing some simple analysis using all the expensive licenses we had, and got the attention of the team lead. now i'm doing analysis on the entire backlog of data across my department to find trends and such. again, nothing complex, just plugging into matlab and such, but beyond the scope of what i was hired for.

well about a month ago our technology sme came down with long covid (brain fog, reduced lung capacity, etc). as said before he's 70+ and decided to retire rather than try to come back to work, meaning his position is now open.

well today my boss called me out of the blue and offered me the position of technology sme given my ability to use most of the software we have. it's a huge promotion in terms of pay, but also in terms of responsibility and oversight. there's a lot of contract and management stuff in that position as well. the job listing wants 10+ years experience plus a masters. ""i'll be here to help with the stuff you don't know and (company) will pay for your master's so we shouldn't have any problems"" is what my boss said about my concerns.

i'm obviously ecstatic about the pay raise and i've worked really hard and such but i'm concerned that i'll be over my head and i'll flame out/end up worse off than before or even fired.

is it possible that i'm just dealing with imposter syndrome? or am i right to be concerned that i'm being promoted too quickly?

edit: thanks for all the replies! i appreciate the feedback and you've helped me quell my concerns. i'll be meeting with my boss and the other relevant parties tomorrow for a more in depth discussion, so hopefully everything turns out great!",53,2720,10,486

the problem i have is when something is not completely straightforward textbook regurgitating/studying, i just don't know what to do. i never know what details are important and which are not. when i go to meetings it feels like everyone is speaking another language and i don't even know what are good questions to ask. also, whenever someone explains something to me i have to manually force myself to focus, and even then i instantly forget most of what they said if it contained too much detail. i work with really smart people and they always describe everything in great detail. my biggest fear is i will end up being there a year or two and still not know a goddamn thing. i work for the government so everything is classified and it's hard to get information about a project without getting it from someone. i also really suck at public speaking or speaking in general. whenever i know i have to ask somebody questions or explain what i did, i have to memorize what i am going to say over and over so i don't forget.. and even then i end up forgetting everything.

it feels like this: if i have to think ahead at all or plan for something that is not directly in front of me it feels almost impossible. even things that i have done myself i rarely remember the details of. i also lack coherent logical thought so i always end up zoning out while doing something and making careless errors. i spend most of the time at my desk thinking ""think of the task!"" and then zoning out or worrying about stupid shit. i feel annoying constantly asking for help but i also don't want to get stuck. i can feel people getting annoyed with me a lot because they always have to repeat themselves over and over because i forget everything.

anyway, i've had this idea for a build for years that was inspired by the mad max: fury road movie. there's a [scene in the movie](https://i.imgur.com/zi2yhfx.mp4) where they are being chased by trucks that have these guys on poles, they are called polecats. i want to put drummers (myself) up there at music festivals and other events, as shown by [this concept art](https://i.imgur.com/4wtgssg.jpg) i had done years ago. and [this](https://i.imgur.com/4vgmwro.mp4) is a [ridiculously basic] render i did of what i thought it could look like on the ground.  
  
i'm a pretty good amateur metal worker and have built most of our contraptions myself, but this is obviously not something i'm even going to touch as i'm not an idiot and understand this requires some real engineering.  
  

i've been out of work for almost a year because of covid, but i figured this could be a great side project to get started on, at least on the consult level. my plan is to hire an engineer (is that even who i need?) to help me design this thing and do a cad drawing (again, is that what i need?) so that i can hit the ground running when the time comes and i sell this concept for an event. i will also be hiring an aerial rigger (the circus kind) for a consultation on how to properly/safely rig a person to this thing.  
  

the caveat to this whole thing is that i'm a stickler for builds that can come apart and fit in a cargo van or box truck. i hate when things don't come apart. the drawing/render i made is ridiculous because obviously there isn't going to be just one pole. so my hope was that i could build this using modular components and something like [aluminum triangular truss](https://i.imgur.com/sfqgfba.png) for the pole so that it's structurally sound but is also light weight and comes apart, since i want the drummer to be ~20ft in the air. 
  
so my questions are:  
1) is this a thing that requires an engineer or am i looking for someone else?  
2) what kind of engineer am i looking for so i can get a consultation and eventually have them design it with me.  
3) when i do figure out what kind of engineer i need, what is the best way to find this person? do i just put up an ad on craigslist that i need someone to help me design this thing?

please think big and engineer a fungible parent container to improve the layout, absorbing the variation in cube of oversize and standard packages. the containers will be used as the final sortation, associates moving the packages from a conveyor and into this container. then, the same container is then staged, and loaded. in 2020, amzl network cube per package increased by 19% (0.37 to 0.54 cut/ pkg) with individual site variation up to 0.28 cut/pkg. this resulted in average pick cycle time increase of 9 minutes 31 seconds (+22%) directly contributing to late wave departures. the goal is to create a container that holds both oversize packages unsorted and standard packages that are sorted into bags. this container needs to absorb the variation of package cube, reducing the variation in downstream processes. as the associate moves packages from the conveyor and sort directly in the same container that will be stage. please ensure to include a high level model with fill in data.

&#x200b;

**my approach**

* the objective is to design a container/tote which can hold enough standard packages & over-sized packages associated with a single order. this container/tote with 1 completed order is then staged and loaded
* a couple of ambiguity with the problem
   * i believe the metric **cut/pkg** is a typo and it actually means cu ft./pkg since a cube is normally mentioned in cu in. or cu ft. and the 0.37 to 0.54 value should be cu ft. has anyone in amazon heard the term cut/pkg?
   * *the network per cube increased by 19% (0.37 to 0.54 cut/pkg) -* i believe the 0.37 to 0.54 is a range of values for the network cube per package value (**since 0.37 to 0.54 is a 47% increase**). please do let me know what you think about this.
   * the pick cycle time - i am not sure if they meant it as the pick to ship time or cycle time of just the pick process since this is a warehousing term varying between sites. but i assume this is pick to ship since it corresponds to late wave dispatches.
* i assumed that the 639.36 to 933.12 cu in./pkg are the cube of standard packages and from [here](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/201105770) i took the cube of oversized package as > 2016 cu in./pkg
* i derived a maximization problem to maximize volume based on x(s), x(os) & var.
   * 639.36 <= x(s) <= 933.12
   * x(os) >= 2016 cu in.
   * \-0.28 <= var <= 0.28

the difficulty i had was on how to incorporate the pick cycle time to this model since there is a direct effect of container size on pick cycle time.

please let me know your thoughts on this problem at a high level.

i would be happy to chat and discuss on it.",154,2694,30,473

current job. the pros are that i'm doing pretty exactly the type of work i want to do in an industry i want to be in. im really interested in the products we make, my job is really hands on, and i get to work on a lot of interesting stuff like machine vision, software and plcs . the problem is the place is an absolute mad house. i've never seen a place such a shitshow. quality problems left and right. pushing out garbage, numbers numbers numbers. priorities change on the flip of a coin. really bad labor on the floor. no upkeep by operations and can't trust an operator to do anything. i've had 3 bosses in 2 years, management always changing. can't even keep workers in the covid era. high turnover of engineers. job is manufacturing engineer, 65k salary. no worry about job security at the moment with record sales

this new job is with large defense contractor a as manufacturing engineer. seems a bit boring but not completely awful. lot of work instructions and not nearly as hands on. lot of smaller volume mixed manufacturing so not any real use for the automation stuff i like. but it's at least a 15k pay bump. worried about job security tho with how covid has been

what would you do in my situation? would you follow the money or try and get a counter offer from current work? or not try and change jobs in the middle of covid? quick background of me, masters degree with 2 yrs exp and 1.5yrs of internship exp.

appreciate any feedback, thanks!

let me know if i can provide details on anything

i spoke with my boss (vp of the firm; the president is basically retired) yesterday to see what the timeframe could be to return, and they said they were at 55% of pre-covid billing and wouldn't be able to bring me back until at least 2021. so i started looking at what other positions are out there, mostly out of a sense of due diligence.

i find that they have my exact job listed on glassdoor, with a lower pay range than i was making before. i was somewhat put off by this, to say the least. telling me that they didn't have mechanical design work to give me while looking for a cheaper alternative strikes me as disingenuous.

0,To P/F or not to P/F,1,57,50,1605530073,"to p/f or not to p/f college senior here and wondering how employers will view me p/f courses. i'm not worried about grad school just life after graduation.

the pro:

since i'm a senior, i'm basically determining the final result of my gpa that gets glued onto my resume indefinitely. i can increase/maintain whatever it currently is very easily. after a few years, my gpa will not matter so much and my p/f classes will matter even less so the higher gpa will have a better lasting impression in the future, especially if i keep it on my resume for the next 20 years.

&#x200b;

the con:

p/f major coursework is an unusual thing. with current events, its not so unusual since most schools allow this, so people will be taking advantage. however, when an employer looks at your transcripts, they will notice this and will not like it. they can either bring it up during an interview (negative connotation) or flat out throw your application (terrible). many applications do ask for transcripts with your resume these days.

the worst thing about this p/f is i would use it for major lvl coursework. if it was for some random elective, i wouldn't care. but things are not looking so good in a few of my classes, so using the p/f ability is an obvious choice. out of my 5 classes, 3 are not too hot. p/f 60% of classes this semester looks extremely silly. say i have this cases

a a c c c (2.8) -> a a c p/f p/f (3.3) -> a a p/f p/f p/f (4.0). the weight associated to the gpa decreases but the averaged total gpa improves. i personally would do option 2 cause why option 1 if you can help it, and option 3 seems fishy.

my thinking was that there might be a material that would allow me to use a magnetron from a microwave because i know that can heat water to the temperature i need, i can get one and i can make this without shocking myself. 

if this is possible i need a material that can sit between the magnetron and the liquid, broadcasting microwaves through the material (ceramic? some kind of bulletproof glass?) so the microwaves hit the water and heat it up, but this material would also have to withstand the rather significant pressure. 

the other idea i had was to have the water moving, fast. i figured if its moving fast enough, bernoulli would keep the pressure down and a more conventional glass might work? bearing in mind... i kinda doubt that my understanding of bernoulli principal is even right

while i'm happy with my job, i know i won't be here forever. i finally have money and time to spend on projects i always wanted to do in college, but even on the weekends (which are pretty empty), i have absolutely *no* energy to do them.  for example, i've had everything on hand i need to rebuild one of my 3d printers, for *months*, but just haven't had the desire to do it. even though i'm pretty damn confident it'll work. the same can be said about oil changes or dishes- even though it only takes 20 mins, and i've got nothing going on, i have an '*ugh do i have to'* mentality about it. that doesn't seem healthy to me, and it's been this way for close to a year.

for now the plan is just knuckle down for a few years and learn as much as i can so that when i'm ready to move i'll have earned a little more professional mobility. is it too early to start looking for jobs? i just want to get a sense of what's out there, what my resume should look like, who to reach out to etc so that i can set myself up for a quick turnaround. i don't want to get to that 'ready to move on' mentality and be stuck looking for another year or 2.

i am interested in noise pollution in particular, in hk we often have people with environmental background working on noise pollution / noise impact assessment, but i have a feeling that this is more a mechanical engineering thing in aus.

the past month, upper management has been micromanaging because we've fallen behind. i've asked my functional manager about switching teams and he has told me at this point, i've become too integral to the team that they aren't going to let me leave (i need team approval to leave). he has told me if this team i'm currently on goes under, he can place me in another team, but right now, the team has requested that i don't leave. 

the work itself is so brain dead and tedious and really has no technical challenge. the challenge is that everything is so obscure i have to pull different people from different teams and hope that they have enough to show me how to do things.

last week, another manager told me that my sprint tasks aren't getting done on time. so i told him that i have to split time with person a in the lab and half of what i'm working on is reliant on his work and i'm doing my best to finish it. i'm also helping person a so we can finish it all faster together. told me i should consider working a 3rd shift to get more lab time for myself and i say i'm not going to do that. then says i don't have any skin in the game. this kind of pissed me off so i told him when this company decides to hand out generous bonuses and rsus, then maybe i will have some skin in the game. told me i'm on thin line and then i guess he talked to my functional manager about my behavior. my functional manager told me that there are other teams looking for engineers, but the current team won't let me go. reassures me again that if this project fails, i'll always have a job since my skillset is far more diverse than most the engineers here. 

it actually feels like the pressure is due to how dumb everything is run here. none of this stuff that i'm working is challenging, yet somehow it is. the challenge feels like it's artificially made. i stopped trying at this job and am now starting to look for another job as of yesterday. i've been studying up algorithms in hopes that i'll get into a bign, but i don't know if i can last another 6 months here. i had intended to study for 6 months, but with what happened last week, i don't know if i can last. 

another software engineer on the team literally gave a 3 day notice to quit last week for a new job as well and morale is low. i knew he was sick of the work as well and saw it coming. after he left, the other engineers on the team have asked me to please not quit.

* would build an engineering related project, solo, to demonstrate skills to demonstrate competence for a resume.
* would learn about the basics of engineering, the real differences, and how to think when solving an engineering problem so you're not clueless as to what you're doing.
* in college take as many labs as possible in physics and do as many experiments as possible to get familiar with having to be hands on and not just be doing theory.
* get a phd in physics that is heavily related and more on the practical side of exactly what you want to work in within engineering. so instead of specializing in qm, specialize in laser or semiconductors which could be more practical.

if there are any succesful engineers here, in order to get to this point, did you really neglect your social or love life? isn't it ok to have hobbies (dance, playing guitar) and improve on those too or have a loving and great relationship with an awesome girl? isn't it ok to experiment as many things as you can in your free time and make new friends and connections (even if they are not in the engineering field)?

this was originally supposed to appear at the beginning of april, but for obvious reasons it didn't get posted on time. now that some states / countries are beginning to lift restrictions and re-open, this *should* mean some companies are hiring again — but if [**this thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/askengineers/comments/h9ul4y/anyone_else_having_a_hard_time_finding_a_job_in/) is any indication, i suspect that most companies are still in a ""holding pattern"" for a variety of reasons, most notably due to potential second waves (and in some places, a continuation) of increasing covid infections.

as with the original, the purpose of this thread is to provide engineering-specific data on salary and compensation / benefits so that others can cross-reference with other data sources like glassdoor and indeed. this is probably most useful for people who are weighing out job offers indifferent geographic locations due to the difference in col.

due to the pandemic, many of us including myself have been laid off or furloughed. as a bit of an economics nerd, i feel it's important to maintain a set of data that reflects what's really happening out there. feel free to include any extra info about your situation as it relates to job searching and engineering.

in this edition of the salary thread i encourage everyone who's been laid off to reply with their compensation before going out of work, and if applicable what the compensation is at your new job. i'll be the first one to leave a comment (under the aerospace category).

the chip has to be able to detect if the ball is in the cup through a piece of glass/acrylic, as i want the circuits under a piece of acrylic to make sure they dont get wet, it is beer pong after all.

graduated with my ee degree this past winter with a robotics minor. for the past four months i’ve been working at an architectural mep firm designing electrical systems for buildings, and i’m already very over it. my job mostly consists of quietly toiling away on cad for a finished project i’ll either never see, or is just adding a new set of classrooms to an elementary school. when not doing that, i’m struggling to keep up with a learning curve because despite my efforts, i’m just so disinterested in the work. i looked for a new job, but where i live is far from being considered an “engineering hotspot” so i’m thinking of moving to atlanta in the next 2 years. i have experience doing pcb design and robotics work. i love to tinker and make projects from the ground up, so i was thinking of finding a job at a prototyping firm, or somewhere that does product design, and even toyed with the idea of wanting to do technical set design for tv in atlanta. i wanted to do robotics work when i graduated, but when i look at online job postings, even the more traditional ee roles just sound like my current job with a new field overlaid over it. they all just sound like quiet desk work where i’m forced to learn some new program i don’t give a shit about.

yesterday i was offered a job as a luxury home automation technician. the owner is an ee, and so is my potential new supervisor. the work sounds fun, social, and physical. lots of cutting edge tech to play with. i have ideas on bringing new vr/gaming packages to their entertainment system catalogs bc i love pc building and new tech. my only concerns are:

1) it’s hourly pay. he’s calling this week to negotiate the exact rate. i never expected to go back to hourly after college so idk what to think just yet. very real possibility they offer less than i make now, which i shouldn’t take given student loans about to come up, car payments, etc.
2) my dream is to be a family man w/ 3 kids and a nice home, providing for a family of 5 with the comfort i want requires high earning potential. still want to move out of my region in the next 2 years regardless. 
3) am i limiting myself for the future? will i be less likely to get better jobs later on bc i “stepped down” from engineering to technician? i miss out on personal company growth because it’s a small company so idk how much i can climb. 

thoughts??

in school things were linear for the most part, but the projects i did for fun, or in a group/class setting, my notes were usually so unorganized because i was just putting things together over time. now, i think it's time i learn how to organize my learning/pursuits better. ironically, getting through school didn't teach me this.

tldr;;; looking to create or find a non porous, non toxic soft material for a fleshlight. i don’t understand what makes up ‪silicone and how to learn more.



ok so from the information i’ve read, the less porous the material is the softer it is, but non porous means it can be cleaned properly/no bacteria growth.‬ so obviously i’m looking for a material that is low on the shore a hardness scale but is still non porous. phthalate is apparently bad because that is the cause of chemical burns with sex toys, but this is what would make the silicone soft? 

i don’t know which compounds that make up silicone that influence porosity, softness, heat retention and elasticity, durability etc etc. how does the curing method effect the silicone? i don’t understand what it is i need to create a silicone soft enough for a masturbator cup. is “medical grade” and “food grade” silicones just that because the structure of them is less porous? could the same type of silicone that breast implants use work - and how would i even know how to convey the exact type of silicone formula i want to a factory? i assume the harder silicon that holds the liquid of a breast implant could be used as a coat layer in a masturbation cup, over a softer silicone material that would be toxic with direct contact. what’s the formula of breast implants silicone? how would i learn if it would would be durable enough to hold, and not deteriorate when constantly rubbed? how would a know how durable a type of rubber would be if thinly spread?

but then i see there’s other options like tpe/tpr. it has a low durometer, and the lower the durometer the softer the material...how is this different from the shore scale? i read “tpe is generally considered body safe” - generally, so not always? how can i learn what kinds of silicone are “medical grade” or are platinum cured and how do they differ? how would i be able to communicate this to a factory and check if it’s “good quality”?

i have a lot of questions and idk how to find answers to any of this, google isn’t exactly giving me answers that are referenced from real sources so i’m just ????? i could use what’s already been used for sex toys, but i want to understand if i can make my own product better.",78,2415,14,440

one time a desk fan broke- one of the blades broke off because something fell in it. i wanted to fix it by just breaking off a blade on the other side but i couldn't- it had 5 blades. if it had 6 or 8, i could break one off on the other side without affecting the center of mass too much. this way it could still blow air without vibrating like crazy.

it seems to me like the cost of manufacturing/flow properties wouldn't be all that different if a fan were to have an even number of blades. pretty stupid question compared to the stuff that gets posted here, but is there a reason so many axial fans have an odd number of blades?",64,948,13,162

i didn't know how much field work was expected of me while i was in school because it was never brought up during class. when i started to apply to jobs, they all either required that i live in the country (with no public transit) or make frequent trips to field sites and manufacturing facilities. i couldn't apply to any of these jobs because i can't drive, and i ultimately took a position in education. 

i miss engineering. i want to go back, and maybe even consider going to grad school. so my questions are:

1. did i choose the wrong discipline? are there other engineering disciplines i should have gone into to avoid field work?

2. will grad school help? say i went all the way through and got a phd; would the increased likelihood of being relegated to research help reduce the need for field work on my part?

3. should i give up on engineering? will there always be field work to the extent that i should move on to something else?

any advice you guys can give would be greatly appreciated. i just want to get a realistic grasp of my situation.

0,[Mechanical] How to do weight measurement on a Moving Platform?,1,16,27,1572639626,"[mechanical] how to do weight measurement on a moving platform? hello engineers, 

i am looking for ideas or solution on how to measure measure the weight of material in a tank or silo that is mounted on a truck. 

back story: 
i am trying to make a weight measurement system with load cells that measure the weight of a tank mounted on a truck while the truck is moving. when the truck is moving there is system that dispenses the stuff in the tank outside (no longer on the truck). the stuff that is in the truck are grains of something (i don't know what they are but they about the size of a bean). because of this i need to measure the weight of the tank to know the dispensing rate. flow measurement of the dispensing system is not an option as the dispensing system is using compressed air to suck and shoot out the stuff in the tank. volumetric measurement of the tank is also not possible, since the material surface of the stuff in the tank is not even. 
if this system was stationary, then it would be a piece of cake. but the fact that the ""ground"" under the load cell will be moving, it makes it so much harder. 
when the truck is moving on uneven ground, if the truck goes into a ditch or hits a pothole, the force or shock that is exerted on the load cell will be high enough to cause permanent damage and deformation. i have wasted a lot of load cells this way. 

solution i have tried that did not work: 
i have tried installing load cells with much higher capacity rating than what i am actually measuring. for example, if the tank is 5 ton i have used 4 load cells that each have a 10 ton capacity. when the truck goes into a ditch, with all the help from the suspension system of the truck, the shock is simply too much for the load cells to bear. 

i have design a platform with shock absorbers (air spring dampers) to take some of the shocks, but the cost of such a system just became too much. 

i welcome all suggestions. thanks in advance!",63,1900,10,365

my additional suggestions for a facility like this would probably be to look at where providing a minimum of 6 ach where the ethanol is being pumped per nfpa 497 and probably design a drip pan/leak detection system to shut it down in the event of a leak.  beyond that, i'm not sure if there's something i'm missing regarding the best design practices or potential code requirements for a facility like this since the scale is so much larger than my previous experience where they typically moved a few gallons at a time by hand. because of that, any suggestions for design manuals or code references to read thought would be appreciated!

i deleted my 1st account so that post was gone - from when i was asking how to cope with it.  i left the 2nd post up.


#1 - we were designing a plant out of state.  the plant was 3 hours away from 2 of our operations people.  i spent a lot of time at the plant during procurement to prepare the plant crew, and during construction.  when we reached a checkout/commissioning stage...the operations manage would let the 2 guys drive to the plant daily and go home. the rest of us stayed in hotels.  we were at the plant 8am-6pm most days. so they'd put down 16 hour days. on the 3rd day, the 2 guys would leave after a few hours and go home because they weren't getting paid overtime. the ops manager refused to have them stay in hotels.  so wednesday forward, i was climbing vessels and piping to label instruments, and check wiring, and program certain process devices. because for some fucking reason we didn't buy intelligent on/off valve heads.. so the open/close limits had to be set once it was installed and powered. we went through this crap at multiple sites. once we'd start test running the facility, they'd do the same thing. the last half of the week, i'd be there starting up systems on my own, running the equipment, and then dragging hoses/draining things alone.  one the plants, it was wintertime, and they were all gone. things weren't going well do everything had to be super well drained..it was -8f outside.  i had to put a heat gun on a 2"" ball valve because it had ice in it to get it to drain.

i'd asked the ops manager, 2 directors, and my boss for support... to fix that. and it never changed. they wouldn't force the ops manager to correct that bullshit.


#2 we have an r&d facility. i used to spend a lot of time working next to it. one day i heard, then saw, a small high pressure pump shaking/bouncing.  it was circulating a foamy fluid and just going nuts from the air in the feed.  i saw the return line going to the tank was above the liquid level.  they didn't a dip tube.  i explained that to the guys working with it. they were complaining about the cavitation and the noise. they looked at me.. ""yeah, you might be right. but you're not my boss. i'm not changing that line.""

#3 2 years ago we sold a large system. i had to design a work platform.  i drew it, and discussed it with the fabricator to use 1"" square tubing.  the operator was up 5 feet, and i didn't see an issue with that tubing on a 2' x 3' platform for intermittent cleaning of the tank. especially because i designed the system such that it wouldn't need the cleaning.  2 days later, i see the work, and the fabricator decided he could to it all out of 3/4"" threaded pipe. he's got it all welded, and it looks like ass, and ruined... but the shop manager argues it's good enough, and i let it go.  the customer laughed at it and rejected it.
i drew a new ladder for them. it goes out, doesn't match the dimensions, so they reject it.  the platform wasn't installed at the height in my drawings. i drew the ladder to match my drawing. shame on me for not catching that original platform in the as-builts.

finally.. dear god. i draw a 3rd platform. with osha research.  platform and ladder.  fabricator argues that i'm an idiot and that it doesn't need to be 1.5"" pipe. he says osha says it can be 1"".  i tell him to go get the paperwork, and if it says 1""...we'll do that. but i need a reference..unless if he wants to tell the customer that.  i have the osha guidance that shows 1.5"" sch40.  i know it's overkill, but it's like $250 in materials, it doesn't matter that much.  the paper says it, so we follow it, and we can all move on.  he builds the platform, but won't install the safety chain. thursday evening, i'm drilling holes in the piping to put in the eyebolts and hanging the chain.  it goes out, customer likes it, and they accept it...they said they'll weld it to our system, and we're good.

i have drawings, pictures, and a bom.  a year later the customer buys the same system.the fabricator keeps stepping over my materials on the ground. he builds a whole platform out of 1.25"" pipe.  but i had submitted the pics/drawings to the shop in 1.5"".  the fabricator loses his mind and is screaming at me that i'm wrong and i don't know what i'm talking about.  he says my drawing said 1.25"" pipe.  well let me see your drawing.  he hoes to his shelf, gets a binder and pulls out a drawing, and he starts waiving it in my face and screaming at me again. won't let me look at it.  he stops, shoves the drawing towards me, but won't move his thumb....move your thumb.  under his thumb, the text says 1.5"" sch40 pipe.  he throws a chunk of pipe and goes out for a smoke. he comes back and looks at the pictures and argues up and down that he never built that platform and that it's 1.25"" pipe.... dude its in your work area. this is your coffee mug in the picture.
a week later it's all corrected, and installed..

#4 because this just bothers me. every 4-20ma level sensor we use... you have to type in an analog value of ticks to set 0 and 100%.  there's no button for ""set tank empty"" and ""set tank full"".... someone has to type in 6200 and 6910 or 6915 etc to scale the transmitter each time.  my former programmer refuses to do it differently.",67,5460,11,1053

last year we got a new big manager who is stricter on pto. he essentially banned all late december pto around christmas and new years for everyone, both new employees and senior engineers who've been here 20+ years, who according to them haven't had this happen before. this hasn't exactly made people too happy. i don't know if this is a temporary or permanent event, there were some projects that got delayed so the last quarter will be especially busy, but he apparently tried to do this last year even when we weren't especially busy, so i'm not so sure.

i read that stacking fans in series doesn't increase flow rate but static pressure. does this mean it has more 'sucking power', as in can it suck smoke from a longer distance? if i blew smoke perpendicular to the front fan instead of towards it, would the fans be able to suck it up better?

0,The State of AskEngineers (2019),1,135,24,1571551740,"the state of askengineers (2019) # overview

hey everyone, it's been a hot minute since i've done one of these and i wanted to give an update as to what all is going on these days with askengineers. i'll try to keep this brief, but there are a few things in the pipeline.

as always, your feedback is important and we're always looking to improve. please use this thread as a forum to ask questions, express concerns/grievances, etc. critical comments are welcome as long as they're constructive.

# 1. updated css

askengineers is now using r/eddited, courtesy of /u/12px. it's not actively maintained anymore, but it's much more simplified compared to the old code. the old code had quite a few bugs which prompted me to finally sit down and roll out this update.

please report any bugs with the new style, and we'll do what we can. unfortunately no one on the mod team has much css experience, so if you're interested in helping out in this capacity please [**message us.**](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskengineers)

unfortunately the `dm` url prefix to enable native **night mode** doesn't work with this style by default, so if you want night mode you'll have to use res for now.

# 2. filters

probably the number one complaint i've heard is that askengineers has too many career posts. i understand the frustration and often it feels like they've taken over the sub. however, at the same time it has generated some of the more interesting discussions and it seems like there are plenty of users that want to discuss career topics. i've tried my best to remove some of the more spammy topics like *""what major should i pick?""* and similar posts, and redirecting those people to our faq which i think does a fair job of answering the question.

regardless, career advice posts are here to stay and we'll continue to manage them. but if you prefer to not see any career posts at all, there is now a filter in the sidebar which will do just that. this obviously only works if users flair their posts, and we do have automod set up to remind all ops to do so, which seems to be working. i was completely remiss on this for a long time, and i apologize for that.

also be sure to use the **hide** button below the post title if you don't want to see it.

# 3. new recurring topics

recently we've gotten some ideas for potential recurring threads. the two most popular ones are:

1. ""what's your salary?"" (quarterly)

1. [engineering challenges](https://old.reddit.com/r/askengineers/comments/d80gkq/how_about_a_monthly_raskengineers_challenge/) (courtesy of /u/mudtug)

the first is easy to implement, while the second requires considerably more logistics. depending on how the challenges are setup, it would take more bandwidth than the mod team has right now, but we're still interested in setting it up in a way that makes it easy to participate. feedback and ideas on this are welcome.

# 4. other stuff

* setting up acronym bot (this request is a year old, if you want to add to the acronym list go here: https://old.reddit.com/r/askengineers/wiki/acronyms)

* user flair applications are on hold indefinitely until we expand the mod team to the point where we can process applications in a timely manner.

* faq additions / updates planned

* sidebar cleanup planned, specifically the ""resources"" section

* minor rules revision planned (mainly wording to provide clarity)

for me, i stayed on the technical side for 2 reasons:

1. management here is not considered a promotion, it is a lateral move; managers make no more money and in some cases less money than their reports.
2. managers are viewed as more disposable than staff level engineers as a manager's skillset is more generic.
3. high level technical people can move companies more; how many postings come up for ""hiring engineering director, apply here""?",103,572,20,76

* numerical methods
* mathematical physics models
* thermodynamics and transport phenomena

my issue comes when they were talking to the department manager about their decision. they mentioned they had spoken with me, their mentor, about this decision. so now the department manager and general manager are breathing down my neck to change their mind and dislike that i told them i don't think i can without false promises or lying. they countered with, ""you're their mentor. it is really your responsibility to persuade them that this is a better decision, especially after the two rotations we have put into this candidate"". so, what i am reading from this, is to pressure my mentee into thinking they owe us and convince them to stay. i am ethically and fundamentally against this, so i told them i would only give them my opinion about potential career growth and different paths available. i work for a huge employer, so the growths and paths available are truly abundant. 

any of you had a situation similar to this? how do you think i handled it? is this common for employers, because it seems to me it would just breed discontent amongst those affected. this would not only cause them to leave eventually anyway, but dislike/speak negatively about the employer anyway. they may be a bit rough around the edges about this because our group has needed people and wasn't able to find them, so we have been training them and this employee is a good one.",51,2013,8,362

the ""scrap"" is nothing but raw material of a certain shape generated internally and fit for use. since we understand the ""scrap"" is of high value, we store and preserve it in the same way as raw materials are.

i will reiterate if it isn’t already clear, the quality of the product is not at all affected by the use of scrap, since the material is exactly the same, but of irregular and uncontrollable shape. we can’t really design the large part (from which the scrap was generated) to obtain a desirable shape/size of the scrap.

but we have challenges while trying to maximise our utilisation of scrap. one of them being -  not able to accommodate the scrap in the tool designed for fresh raw material sheets.

to get around this, we make certain modifications to the tool to accommodate the scrap. sometimes, we end up increasing the cycle time of the process in doing that, but the raw material value saved is way higher, and enough to compensate for the higher processing time. again, the modifications do not compromise safety or product quality in any way.

according to the rules laid down, we are obligated to inform our customer for any tool changes that we do. the modifications should warrant strong reasons for it, and the customer is also required to conduct an audit of the new tool (lengthy and consumes time and resources)

the only problem with informing our customer is – the customer will ask for price reductions after considering our reasons for modifying the tool. after all the brainstorming and hard work we put in to maximise scrap utilisation, it seems very unfair to give the benefit from it to the customer (since we are already operating on razor thin margins). so, our final stand is - we do not inform our customer when we modify the tools for scrap utilisation.

recently, i’ve questions about this practise in my mind, but not sure where i can ask with anonymity whether this is right or wrong.

tl;dr - to increase value generated after processing certain raw materials, we modify tools without informing customer (so that we are not asked to reduce prices)",118,2328,19,395

i would very much like to move there for a period of time and work, for the life experience and to be with my girlfriend again. she moved back home, graduated 1 year earlier than i did.

&#x200b;

any advice, including: things to note on a cover letter or resume, information i should withhold or disclose regarding my situation with possible employers, places to look for jobs of this nature, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

 well after much trial and error it works but it needs about 25lbs of counterweights on each of the 4 corners. the trouble is i can’t think of anything to use other than used free weights that would weigh enough and yet occupy a small enough amount of space. the problem is most people want 70¢ to $1 a pound for used free weights and i really don’t want to spend another $70- $100 on counterweights.

any ideas? and where can i find it?

i am at something of an impass. i want something to change but at the same time i have doubts i can actually vet employement and come out ahead. 

i am an ee grad with about 6 years solid design experience and i work in programming and cad based design of digital things. there are electrons and stuff. i guess i am something of a specialist.

this large company is rather broken. there are all kinds fiefdoms and people defending their technical territory. i realize now that we are something of a leviathon and its not important for most parts to be doing top tier work, what is needed are bodies in chairs slowly, inexorably moving key projects forward (for most positions). 

while we are on occasion pressured to put in raw hours, nobody is facilitated to operate at peak ability, and few people try, most are stuck in a stable low-middle gear, which is so common the many people who have been around 10+ years can’t even see it. so many meetings. the pay is decent but far from great. there are rarely any raises, blanket policy across the board that there are no raises most so far. there is never any upside for doing anything exceptional. rarely any downsides for failure as there are lots of institutional factors or other groups to blame.

suffice to say about 20-30% of our working hours are wasted, more if some considers dead end projects. the everyday stuff is due to it issues were just everything we do hamstrung. i probably spend about 30 minutes a day just logging into different system for example, reopening sessions when they crash. it is death by a thousand cuts. 

some years ago i left a company that was a high functioning pressure cooker (and stressful) and when i think about what we used to accomplish, it makes me well, somewhat concerned for my career going forward. 

where i am now, albeit stymied by the lack of it/equipment resources i get a lot done in a relative sense to others.  i know without a doubt i could be doing some really exceptional work somewhere. i am doing some exceptional work now but things are not structured that i will see any benefit from that. for example when i have done good/interesting work we don’t proceed with what has been developed for institutional reasons, many others have had similar frustrating experiences and joke not to get wrapped up in that. other companies would make products of these things but not the leviathan.

at least its largely a stress free existence (besides having to watch bad policies being rolled out by hr/corporate, benefits slashed in creative ways and that kind of thing).

here is the thing; i had no idea what i was getting into. i like to think i will ask better questions in an interview but how much can you ask before you torpedo your chance of being hired? you want to show as a keener. you can’t really ask exact technical specifications in interviews or if they cut raises and set up the bonus structure not to pay out or if the interesting work is being horded by another team that is failing at it without consequence.",299,3137,50,556

i have recently gotten really into the world of tech and read books about artificial intelligence and app development over the summer and really think i would like to work in app development. in my first year at college i took coding classes for the first time (public school system isn’t the best in my area) in c++ and matlab and arduino. i really liked coding and easily got as in both classes, to be fair they were beginner courses but covered things like if, for, while loops file inputs/outputs.
while reading up online alot of people say getting a bioengineering degree isn’t the best choice as it is too broad etc. 
i am really having trouble with choosing a major as i am so unsure about what the future will hold. i don’t have any mentors, and my family doesn’t care. if i try to confide in them, especially my parents they just throw their own experiences in my face and leave me feeling more hopeless and sad then before.

i know ""julie"" from work, we both are engineers, she started a while after me and is newer to the industry than me, and i've been trying to help her do well professionally. teach her the ropes and all. up till she was hired, i was the only woman in a team of 20 and i've had to work though some difficult stuff. and if i can help make things easier for women who enter the field, after me, i sure want to. along with work stuff, we've also become pretty good friends.

she came to me with something she was having trouble with at work. during her internship with our company last year, her manager was ""john"" and her peer mentor was ""dan"". she didn't tell anyone at the time, but dan wasn't too good of a mentor. he actively discouraged her from going to other people for help or guidance, it seemed like he had a bit of an ego and wanted to be the only one guiding her work. he also talked down to her a lot. (side note, none of this surprises me, i have worked with dan as an equal, and even then he has an abrasive and domineering personality. in my experience, he is a poor communicator, and does not understand what the team is doing as a whole, while the rest of us communicate a lot more closely, and ask questions about what we don't understand)

fast forward to this year, she's been hired full time. john as her direct manager. she's no longer mentored by dan, they're on the same level in the company. 

this was about the time we started becoming friends, i didn't know her well when she was an intern because she really kept to herself then. this year, she told me about her trouble with dan, and said that even now, he's being a pain. he seems to be telling her what to do, on parts of the project that she is in charge of. he went over her head, and over her manager john's head, to talk to the top boss at the office about the timeline of her work. and he is still being domineering about the work she is doing, even though it is her work and not his. he has his own totally separate tasks.

julie went to our manager john about her role in the company, asking him to clarify if she was supposed to be managed by him or dan. and he said in no uncertain terms that he was her direct manager, and she and dan were peers.

but even after that, dan is still acting like he is still her superior, trying to manage her time and her work. sometimes his instructions conflict with john. and she wanted advice from me about how to resolve things. 

i want to tell her to go to john and tell him ""dan has done xyz relating to my work, those all seem like management tasks. and as he is not my manager, you are, could you please clarify his role on the project with him, so there is no further confusion? i understand he may be in the habit of managing my work, as he did when i was an intern, but now it is difficult having two people giving me conflicting guidance on xyz topics.""

but... i know i have a bit of an overly direct bordering on confrontational way of addressing things. and i don't want to give julie bad advice just because i'm annoyed on her behalf. can i have some input on whether my advice is good, or if there is a better way to resolve things?

&#x200b;

 (for those who don't know, it's quite common to use a single, very large, nut to torque large propellers or rotor-heads on. it's colloquially called a ""jesus nut"" in this application because it's such a critical point of failure that if it falls off, you're going to meet jesus). simple concept. i'm just geeking out on it. 

&#x200b;

 in a c-130 airplane i used to work on, the propeller is centered on the shaft via a rear split-cone (sitting on a flange machined on the shaft) and a front split-cone, with some drive splines in the middle. a big 'jesus-nut' squishes the whole thing together with somewhere around 2,000 ft/lbs of final torque. my understanding is that this doesn't cause any bearing preload, so it's just stretching the prop shaft. the propeller itself goes through positive and negative torque situations in flight. after personally removing the prop, you can see that there is zero fretting of either front or rear drive cone, leading me to believe that at least a portion of the torque load is taken up by friction between the drive-cones and the shaft.

&#x200b;

the s-61 helicopter i now fly has about the same method of attachment (the whole rotor head sits on some drive splines between an integrated cone on bottom and split-cone on top) 'jesus nut' is applied and torqued...by hand...until it stops. yes. 0-torque. my understanding is that the head in this situation is also not pre-loading any bearings.

&#x200b;

 my question is this: why would one scenario require a torqued jesus-nut while the other scenario doesn't? wouldn't an un-torqued fastener allow for the possibility of slop (if even a few thousandths axially/radially), causing unnecessary wear on the cones, an off-balance condition of a 2000+lb rotor head, etc etc?",43,2053,5,340

that particular south american country is very safe, so i'd not be fearing for my life (too much).

i already interviewed once with them, and made very clear that ""yes, i can come to south america, but will be for european level salaries"". i'll have soon a 2nd interview with a top-dog in the company, and i was thinking of asking for a really high package:

i work with a machine which needs forced water cooling. 

we recently bought a new system and hired a company to setup the cooling system for us. given the requirements of the machine, they were supposed to deliver a reliable cooling system to us.

we are struggling for a few weeks now, because the system keeps leaking. the company we hired said that the diameter specified by the machine supplier was too small. the coupling piece from the hose with bigger diameter to the hose with smaller diameter is often leaking. how can i calculate the correct diameter given a flow rate?

some information about the system:

the working environment is clean, inside a building with climate control, and the water temperature for the given specifications will always stay below 20°c. the pipes are made of pvc nylon braided hoses, similar to garden hoses. 

system specs:

line 1: 11 to 15 liters a minute
line 2: 1 to 3 liters a minute
line 3: 8 to 12 liters a minute

line 1 and 3 are often leaking, especially 1. line 2 almost never leaks.

i would really appreciate either some way to proper calculate the correct hose diameter or how to tackle problems like this. we have no mechanical engineer in our group, and this has been rather frustrating. feel free to use advanced math or calculus if needed, i am an ee.

any advice will be appreciated, especially formulas to calculate the minimum hose diameter.

the best answers were about the municipality planning other lines above/below existing tracks or that the depressions helps acceleration and the climb back up reduces braking - thus reducing wear and tear on components.  these answers make sense.

however, many started saying that it saves energy because when a body in motion goes into a dip rather than a straight line, somehow it saves energy.  my understanding of conservation of energy rejects this because although it might sound intuitive, it cannot be physically true - travelling the same distance in a perfectly horizontal line must be the lowest energy way of travelling.  some people with ""(source: engineer)"" sign offs disagreed.

what really bugs me is that i understood the math when we were doing it. but each test covered about a months worth of material. by test time, i essentially had to relearn the material from a month ago and it was just so much material in between tests that i couldnt remember it all even though i knew how to do it. i went to tutoring, went to my professors door every single day after class, and spent every moment in my free time working on math. but in the end i couldn't make it.

0,"Using the title of ""Engineer""",1,179,275,1566288613,"using the title of ""engineer"" i wanted to get opinions on a line of thinking that i've held for quite some time. i am not an engineer, but i relate quite heavily to this sub because, despite my lack of a degree, i typically find myself doing engineering related tasks for almost every one of my employers. my role at many of these companies ultimately turns into the ""jack of all trades, master of none."" and by that i mean, i end up in many varied roles that often require completely different skill sets. just to give a few examples:

- research and design a process for acetone vapor smoothing of abs plastic parts
- research and design improvements for mechanical and electrical design of custom made 3d printers
- assemble and improve pick and place assembly line machines and implement mechanical improvements
- develop application code (like g-code) pick and place assembly line machines
- develop software (like c++) for pick and place assembly line machines
- machine parts on manual and cnc machining equipment (usually for said assembly line machines, but sometimes for other stuff)
- maintain and troubleshoot cnc machining equipment

as you can see, a lot of my duties overlap with duties typical of junior software, electrical, chemical and mechanical engineers. i usually don't do mechanical design, but i have designed a few small parts in the past.

but i'm not an engineer. my job title doesn't have engineer in it. (however, my boss refers to me as ""one of his engineers"")

and until i go to school to get an engineering degree, i will never be one. i personally think calling myself an engineer dilutes the term significantly. i don't believe i'm nearly as effective at some of my duties as a properly trained engineer would be.

however, whenever i describe my job to someone new, they usually say ""oh, so you're an engineer!"" and i have to quickly correct them that i'm actually... you know... not an engineer. and i always felt like this was the right and respectful thing to do given that i basically cheated my way to a position most people have to work for years to land.

the other position is a sales/field engineer position that i think would really suit me and much more up my alley. it doesn’t pay as much (base salary) and i don’t earn commission until 6 months after i start. also the territory i will be in is new so i will pretty much be starting from the ground up. both jobs are in the same location.

i started a new job as a senior software engineer. i feel like i'm not the only person who does this; the people on my team seem to do this, but just spread out their ""not coding"" time other ways (playing ping pong, reading each other's merge requests, socializing, etc.) 

today my boss found out i do this when i started reading some specs for another task. short story short, he wasn't happy, and i'm kind of at a loss about how to explain this without looking weak or incapable. i was sick this week, so i was trying to do work from home, and he kept telling me to take off. 

truth be told, i can't afford to take off, despite having the flu. it took them a month and a half to hire me after my initial (supposed) start date, and after a month and a half of working there, i've only been paid for 1 week of working there because of their pay schedule. i really need money after not being paid for 3 months. 

so i'm doing whatever to keep up my velocity, including doing other tasks than the one i picked before i got sick. i spent a long time on a simple error before i realized that i needed to define something simple. realizing my mental capacity was not 100%, i started working on other tasks, reading things that were trivial for me compared to what others could do. 

he found out, we had a bit of a tiff, and i'm left baffled. i can't be the only one who needs a break after coding for a while. coding is hard. it's why software engineers are paid so much despite all the information in their heads being available on the interwoben.

my first almost 4 years was as a mechanical test engineer in the elevator industry. i developed and executed a wide range of tests (basic tensile tests on up to full system/controls testing), analysed results, and wrote technical reports along with a bunch of side work like fixture design, choosing the right instrumentation, and using first principles to determine what should happen. 

the issue that i haven't worked directly under a pe. my state requires either direct supervision or indirect supervision with clarification as to the degree of supervision. there was one pe in my old company who was helping as an ""indirect supervisor"", but honestly i haven't wanted to spend the time required to apply only to have that nearly 4 years totally rejected, plus i don't have any pes available to verify experience at my new company. i've thought about applying in a neighboring state that allows for supervision by someone with ""substantially equivalent"" experience and education, but am not sure if this is a good route or not. 

can anyone share their experience with applying for the license in a similar industry situation? what kind of experience did you put down? how long/exhaustive was your experience record?

so i doubt any renewable energy company would hire me since i have no experience with it. 

so then i was thinking consulting but i applied last year and didn’t get even into the first round of the two internships i applied to & nothing has changed (except i had an internship this summer). 

i’m just freaking out. it all came so fast!! i have only 2-3 months to decide my future job. i wish i could just continue with grad school to give me time to think more about what i want to do or to learn about renewable energy but it’s just not an option, financially.

i have no clue what i’m going to apply to or do in the future. did anyone else feel this way and just get a random job that they got accepted to but then later on in life moved on to a job that  better suited your interests?

0,Mechanical vs Electrical Engineering,1,33,42,1564057499,"mechanical vs electrical engineering so i've been putting off deciding this for a while now and now i'm at a ""fork road"" in my university studies in deciding on a major to continue on.

&#x200b;

a bit of background about myself:

i have taken both mechanical and electrical subjects during my time at university, but both at foundational levels. so in electrical, i've done circuit analysis of basic components such as capacitors and inductors, etc. and in mechanical, i've done fea on a simple body, looked at joints, etc. done all the ""basic"" maths (calculus, linear algebra, etc) and have even done a fair bit of coding (java, c, python), not so much on matlab. 

&#x200b;

i've heard from recent graduates that electrical engineering is quite math intensive as it progresses, whereas from mechanical engineering graduates that mechanical is quite conceptual in terms of ""seeing"" the forces acting on a body. could i please get some insight from people who are studying or working in these fields about what these two areas are like?",36,1008,4,166
0,Is engineering education inherently flawed? So many people on this board make it seem worthless.,1,19,40,1564027413,"is engineering education inherently flawed? so many people on this board make it seem worthless. there's two avenues of this question i want to explore:

1. so many people on this very board talk about how engineering is 5% what you learn in school and 95% what you learn on the job.  that school is really only good for teaching you how to think, but you don't really need to know all that formula crap.  in that case, is 4 years of college really necessary?  what is the worth of the traditional engineering degree?  would you hire an 18 year old or 22 year old that didn't graduate with an engineering degree but seemed like they could pick these things up on the job?  the actual process of getting the degree seems so arbitrary in light of all that.

2. i fall under the category of people who were greatly disappointed with actually working as an engineer.  i actually like the theoretical and mathy part of engineering.  everything from the career fair posters in high school to my college classes and labs made me feel like that was what engineering was.  that i'd be the next faraday or watt, sitting at a desk late into the night, deriving equations and calculating obscure phenomena that i would be able to cleverly put into a design that would do something the world had never seen before.  

call me a pretentious nerd, but i *liked* that idea.  i was annoyed when the bros in college would downplay this math stuff we were learning, cause their dad's friend told them they just needed to get through it for the degree and would never need it again.  then i graduated, and realized that for 95% of ""engineering"" jobs...they were right.  i job hopped for years where the most math i did was filling out a time card.  i slowly realized i was just doing businessy bullshit with powerpoints and spreadsheets, with a hint of a technical flair.  and i was pissed.

as almost everyone on this subreddit can tell you, ""that's just how it is"".  there's not enough ""fun"" jobs for everyone.  doing high level design like that is something reserved for experts over a decade or two into their career, who have paid their dues and mastered the basics of their industry.

but then my questions is...why is the typical 4 year engineering degree so weighted towards that type of work?  it almost seems cruel.  it's like a mlm scheme, where you start off by showing the person what they *could* have.  and then say that you have to basically be an indentured servant for 20 years before you can actually be trusted to do that.

why not have undergrad be 1 year, and barely have anything like surface integrals.  then you work for 5 years.  then you get another year of more difficult math and engineering classes.  then another 5 years of working, etc...  at least i would have had an idea of what i'd be getting into in the immediate term.  the way we do it now seems so old fashioned and misleading.",96,2800,15,525

bare with me.
i’m majoring in mechanical engineering, going into my last year. i started off knowing absolutely nothing about engineering & hated physics (because it was hard for me to understand conceptually). i did like  math though, especially calculus. 
anyway, i came in with no “engineering skills,” so i purposely made myself take a coding class to learn python (just an intro course) and i took a machine shop class (learned how to use the mill and the lathe- although i wouldn’t voluntarily ever go back and use them because they still terrify me/ i’ve forgotten a lot of the steps/rules). 

anyway, i also took a machine elements class that taught all about machine parts (bearings, gears, etc) and we built an rc car (in teams). my teams car, of course, ended up not working right before the race & failed to run. 

but, in all of these mechanic-y type classes, i still feel like i wasn’t able to absorb anything. it’s like my brain just isn’t meant to think mechanically or idk! 

i still dont know anything about mechanics! i learn and then just forget. so i don’t know anything about building something- what parts are needed (like gears, bearings and whatever else) and how engines work or generators or just anything like that. i feel like a total failure. 3 years of college and i don’t know anything. and i always felt, in my mechanical engineering courses, that maybe i shouldn’t have majored in engineering because my brain just doesn’t seem to absorb or grasp any of these mechanical processes. maybe i should’ve gone down a less hands-on route...like biology.

i just don’t feel like an engineer. i do like engineering because of the creativity and problem solving involved. 

but i’m just so frustrated that i don’t have any real engineering knowledge or skills, and i feel so stupid. i’m doing an internship this summer and we were each given projects. one of the guys built a type of sensor from scratch!! i could never!! i wouldn’t even know how to start. 

all i designed was just a container that catches sand and filters out water (through mesh sheets)- the welders here will build it and then i can test it out. but it was so easy to design because it was just a box! i didn’t need to think about machine parts or anything like that- just dimensions. 

for these reasons, i feel that i have to work in something non-engineering after i graduate because i don’t want to embarrass myself / reveal to other engineers that i am ...not really an engineer.

ps i’m a total fraud! i have a 3.9 gpa which would make you think i really learned everything (which i might’ve in the moment) but it’s all gone! i know nothing now. :(((((

***basically, i just want to think more like a mechanic.  i want to be able to talk to an engineer about valves & bearings & engines & pressures & fluid flow & heat transfer- all of which i took classes for but just learned/forgot everything!!!! what book or resource could i use that would teach me all of this in a simple way, that could make me more like an engineer? should i just watch youtube videos of people building parts? maybe what i’m missing is application of principles i learned?***",136,3224,21,569

my boss thinks that because it was his idea for me to make the machine, that he is the inventor. function y (that he requested) is a part of the patent, but many of my own personal upgrades to the machine are also part of the patent. do i have any legitimate claim to be included on the patent?",32,1324,7,257

0,"""Your degree says you can engineer. Specialty doesn't matter.""",1,439,178,1563493909,"""your degree says you can engineer. specialty doesn't matter."" i heard this today. the topic was that every student in my social circle at uni is double majoring. about half are taking two engineering degrees, mostly mech+aerospace or computer+electrical. the other half are doing pairings like computer engineering + computer science or chemical + math. 

we asked an adviser about it and they told us that collecting degrees is usually a waste of time and money unless you're advancing from a bs to an ms or an ms to a phd. that the real employable skills that your degree represents are the problem-solving and analytical skills, and that once you have one engineering degree, you've proven you can grasp the material properly and thus can train into most other engineering jobs.

they claimed to know chemical engineers that now work on the electrical systems of aircraft, and computer engineers that do civil engineering work, etc. they said that unless you were aiming for research or something very niche and specialized, you could always pick up another engineering discipline on your own later.

part of the logic was that your degree only really matters for your first job. after that, your resume is what matters far more. so your fancy double majors and triple minors ended up forgotten. so it's better to pursue higher degrees because they take about the same time as picking up lateral degrees. you can spend 2 years going back to school for a chemical engineering degree as a civil engineer, or you can spend those two years getting a master's in civil engineering and likely do better, even in pursuit of chemical engineering jobs.

a secondary point was the importance of extracurriculars and clubs. the advisers implied to us that it was far, far better to join a club like formula racing, concrete canoe, a robotics competition, etc, and get experience working with a group to achieve a goal than to pick up a second major or minors.

so, my social circle is a bunch of workaholics that spend long hours trying to hold down 20 hour semesters in order to get 2 degrees in 4 years. but now we're hearing that the far better approach would be to settle into a cozy 15 hours max and spend the our free time on personal projects and clubs in order to gain experiences to put on our resumes instead of extra degrees.

so what does this sub think? have we been doing it wrong this whole time?",62,2341,9,406

* what are the consequences? 
* where do we see the consequences in the world?

job 2: got fired after 9 months. supervisor gave average/bad performance reviews and didn't give me feedback on how to improve. 

job 3: got fired after 7 months. no bad performance review or feedback before getting fired. 

&#x200b;

both jobs 2 and 3 said, ""you have 4 years of experience and a pe"" and expected me to hit the ground running. they had high expectations from the start and did not provide much training or feedback to help me improve. both places had a sink or swim environment for new hires. 

&#x200b;

questions:

1. what questions should i ask in future interviews to avoid ""sink or swim workplaces""?
2. what steps should new hires take to hit the ground running?  
3. how to explain my job history to future employers?",61,1120,14,199

recently i have been getting frustrated due to the companies political structure and values. mostly i dislike the morality of the engineering department. i was assigned to work on a project where the head engineer passed away. i found that he never recorded any of his hardware test data. due to this i assumed that their was no testing done because no data was anywhere to be found.  my manager wants to spin the board with only small changes based on the schematic then release even though there are many notable issues with it. i said this in a public meeting (in a frustrated tone which i regret) and my manager yelled at me in front of the whole room. i felt terrible for the rest of the day. 

before this happened we were in a design review for the companies multiple branches around the globe. the head of engineering asked “why do we even have these meetings they just waste time, does anyone gain anything from these?” i responded with “yes, it’s inspiring and innovative to see what our other branches are working on to see what our next npi could be” apparently this was funny because all the managers began to laugh. 

there are many great people who work here and are willing to teach me awesome engineering things. however, a lot of the way the information is kept and shared is outdated (or not recorded at all) or through word of mouth. these instances just made me feel very uncomfortable. i’m debating on quitting and finding a new job. should i wait it out? it seems the deeper i get into this company the more and more uncomfortable i feel.",42,1830,9,336

0,Well water recirculation for house cooling.,1,24,26,1562748328,"well water recirculation for house cooling. this has been an abnormally hot summer for my area, and lots of people are buying air conditioners in droves.  it just seemed like there had to be a better way to take the edge off the heat inside which is hitting well over 80*f.  this got me considering doing a recirculation system off of my well water that comes out of the ground well, faithfully at 36-37*f.  the concept is simple and nothing new.  run a recirculation pump on a loop, through a radiator that would blow air through it, thus transferring heat to the cold water in the loop.  when the water hits a temp where it no longer is efficient to use in the loop it would be either dumped into another pressure tank, or back into the existing tank, whichever makes the most sense.  if in another tank, to keep temp differences separate, a one way valve would make sense, creating a separate closed system.  obviously with this kind of temprature difference you are going to have condensation.  this actually works out in my case as i suspect i can use a catch pan below the radiator that would have pex tubing out to either a drain, outside, or to a container to be later used for watering plants or disposal.  this would serve as a good dehumidifier, which i also need.

one of the major downsides here to water coming out of the ground so cold, is that you cannot efficiently use an on demand water heater.  i suspect that water being heated up in this loop system would greatly increase tank #2 (if feasible) to temps well above 50*f, making it possible and efficient to use in an on demand water heater, further saving energy.

the main issues i can see with this system would be:
how often the well water is cycled into the pressure tank(s). 
finding a radiator material that is drinking water safe.
how much waste energy can be stored in x amount of 36-37*f water?

any engineers care to lay down some math on this one, in regards to water temp/volumes and possibly energy efficiency?  i have the means to set this system up, just wanting to ensure my thoughts are on track and it's realistically efficient.",43,2074,6,383

now, our analysis group is pretty small and handles a lot of work. the lowest ranking employee is a sr. me i. the credentials for getting into the group are generally a masters + 2-3 yrs exp or bachelors +4-5 yrs exp, but they usually want a masters grad. the candidate had a bsme and 3 yrs exp when hired. so the conflict comes when it is offer time. the employee wants a promotion to sr. me i to join the group. since they're a rotational person, they have no real obligation to join despite the training given for the past year. the hiring manager doesn't want to do it because they lack the masters degree or applicable exp in our job description.

so here is the dilemma, i was happily prepping for navy until nasa-jpl called me up offering me a very good engineering job with very good pay in los angeles. basically a dream job for any engineer.

with nasa you get better work/life balance, live a decent social life and also earn a good salary. you can possibly live a happy family life and still have loads of fun at work.

with navy pilot, you get a more rewarding and challenging life. i plan on going to test pilot school and the possibility of even applying to become an astronaut in the future(i know that's some crazy dreams i got). i will lose the family connection and other social aspects compared to nasa. and also there is a chance that for some odd reason, i don't make it through flight training, i will be miserable for a couple of years with a different job at navy. let's just say, if i don't get to be a pilot, there is a good chance i won't like it at the navy. also, i am quite old to be joining the navy as a pilot. i will be 27 at ocs. the good thing is i am not married, at least for now.

in short  
nasa jet propulsion laboratory - nice steady life with great job satisfaction, build stuff and send to mars  
us navy pilot - risky and challenging life with very rewarding career opportunities, think astronaut!

0,Should I Prioritize Pay/Benefits or How Interesting the Work is for My First Job out of School? Offer comparison.,1,118,89,1562014316,"should i prioritize pay/benefits or how interesting the work is for my first job out of school? offer comparison. hey y'all! i'm finishing up my master's in aerospace engineering this fall and thankfully the job search has been fruitful so far. (changing company names for anonymity) i have five offers that i am seriously considering in three vastly different  specializations and locations. weirdly they all are around the same pay but cost of living is quite different. i am just curious if i should be prioritizing how interesting the work is or if i should be focused on paying off my student debt (60k) as fast as possible with the best pay. the kicker here is my fiancee is a teacher who doesn't want to have to relocate a ton as she will have to jump through a bunch of hoops to re-certifiy so wherever i end up geographically i will most likely stay for 6-10 years. here are the three offers so let me know what you think!

&#x200b;

offer 1: defense firm 

job title: systems engineer ii

location: huntsville al (lowest cost of living but alabama isn't the best)

pay: 93k

work type: kill vehicle design for ballistic missile defense. cool stuff but not my absolute favorite. apprehensive about starting my career at a big defense contractor.  lots of ae jobs in huntsville though and could jump around if needed.

&#x200b;

offer 2: smaller aerospace manufacturing firm

job title: systems development engineer ii

location: buffalo ny (super close to home but i hate snow)

pay: 90k with straight overtime (hourly rate after 40hours/week)

work type: aircraft control system design. i have zero experience with aircraft and have no idea how i'll like it. the company had the best benefits but not much else in buffalo to jump ship to.

&#x200b;

offer 3: newspace startup

job title: systems engineer ii

location: cape canaveral fl (yay beach. hurricanes are a thing i guess.)

pay: 90k

work type: satellite bus design for nasa and darpa contracts. company isn't super established (\~200 employees) and the benefits aren't amazing. i am interning here now so i know the work environment quite well. other companies at the cape to jump to.

&#x200b;

offer 4: oldspace developer

job title: spacecraft systems engineer

location: phoenix az (i don't mind the heat all, almost prefer it. teacher jobs are dreadful in az)

pay: 96k

work type: nanosatellite design to support in-house tech demonstrations. company is old school with good benefits. not a ton of diversity in phoenix.

&#x200b;

offer 5: newspace launch provider

job title: advanced concepts systems engineer

location: seattle wa

pay: 97k

work type: lunar lander design (gee i wonder who this could be lol). i would absolutely love to work for this company based on their reputation and subject matter. however the pay/benefits aren't amazing and management seems to be on the fritz currently.

0,What the value of being a P.Eng is. (Canada),1,16,16,1561917283,"what the value of being a p.eng is. (canada) there's been other threads here about what the value is of being a p.eng and a lot of people say things like i don't need it in my position / company, higher risk of liability, fees, only good for indirect perception, etc. there's some truth to all that and here's another flip side. agree or disagree and why?

i've had my p.eng. for over 10 years. originally it was an important factor in my employment engineering firms to be a licensed engineer. now as in project management role where the vast majority of people in my position aren't engineers you might say i don't need. heck just cancel the membership. nothing could be further from the truth. because perception is reality, i would still say for personal branding alone, and the fact that we're managing trades, architects, and licensed engineers on our project teams on-going, that it's still much better to have.

ok lets say you're not even working with other p.eng. on your projects like a typical software engineer. people will say i don't need it for my job, it's all about skills, people around me including higher ups don't have it, and there's some truth about that, but really how do they define what you need? if it's about being employed then you don't need anything but relationships including a degree, mba, leed ap, pmp, p.eng., eng.l. heck even high school is enough since everything can be learned on the job if you think about it. i would say if you think about it in terms of the long game, any engineer including software engineers should get it because of:

1. personal branding. nobody around you has it is actually the reason why you should get it more so then not. your next internal senior software engineering or management position you apply for with 20 applicants and you're the only licensed professional engineer. i mean come on. this is a big part of why conceptually why i was hired to project manage over other equal experienced applicants.
2. personal and professional milestone met.
3. p.eng. is a license to legally practice engineering in your province by the engineering act. being licensed to practiced as a professional does open doors directly or indirectly. even when i apply for management positions, i later hear back we liked your application, hiring a experienced p.eng. is something we like. that even surprised me because all the other managers in the firm aren't p.eng. when all things are equal, anything to set you apart helps.
4. engineering entrepreneur: lets say down the road you want to use your own skills from engineering and run your own gig as a say a sole practitioner. then you really need to being a licensed professional engineer for yourself and the clients. sure everything has a work around like you could hire a p.eng. and manager them and you still can but there's reasons why most managing partners in engineering firms are p.eng. members for credibility among other reasons.
5. liability is a big misconception when it comes to the engineering seal. obviously if you're in a job where you're not using your seal then it's not even a factor but even if you are it goes back to the basics. yes when you seal / sign to a document, you commit to the  standards of the professions and accept  professional responsibility for the document and its contents, however  does that mean if the seal isn't applied, the member is some how not  responsible for their created work? - if you created it, you are  responsible for it—seal or no seal. in fact the engineering seal guidelines state  that you add no extra liability to yourself when you seal your  documents. the seal is not a mark of warranty. it is not a guarantee of  accuracy. the purpose of the seal is to authenticate documents that have  been prepared and delivered by a licensed member in their professional  capacity as a mark of reliance. that's it. nothing magic. i would say the only problems you may run into is if you start sealing / signing documents prepared by somebody else not under your direct supervision. in a rush people have asked me to do that because they're not licensed. i just said no because that wouldn't make sense. get your license or supervisor. that's it.
6. fees: i've worked for a lot of firms (private and public) an they all paid for my engineering membership fees. even in roles where i don't need to be. i would think it would speak to the legitimacy of the firm if they wouldn't even do that. 
7. the list goes on and there's other reasons for sure such as networking and mentoring opportunities as a

0,"What ""simple"" questions do interviewees routinely fail to answer?",1,121,367,1561617079,"what ""simple"" questions do interviewees routinely fail to answer? hi all. i had this thought today (for the 100th time) and wondered what those of you who interview potential hires might have to say.

there are certain fundamentals questions that i ask most candidates. some of these i considered removing because it seems almost insulting to ask a 10-15 year engineer to answer such ""basic"" questions. except that they routinely get them wrong, even with a decent amount of handholding. so i keep them in.

i don't like to ask questions that require memorization of formulas that most engineers wouldn't be able to remember anyway. i do like to ask questions that test whether you have a basic ""intuition"" or understanding of engineering principles.

what kind of questions? things like...you have 2 identical dams holding back water. water level is the same, the dams are the same in all respects, except one dam is situated 1 meter away from a solid wall with water in between. the other dam has an infinite ocean of water behind it. which experiences more force? of course, the force depends on pressure and area. area is the same, so you're left with water: density, gravity, and height. they are also the same. maybe 10% of candidates get this right on the first try. it should be a 15 second question, but it often takes 5 minutes to talk them through the process of figuring it out. 

there is another that involves knowing that - due to it's moment of inertia - a cylinder rolling down a slope will take longer to reach the bottom than a frictionless block of the same mass sliding down the same slope. and again...very few candidates realize that on their own without prodding from me. 

they could be poorly worded questions, but even after it is clarified repeatedly and strong hints are given, many fail to see the connection. or maybe i'm a terrible interviewer! hence this post: have any of you experienced this sort of thing, and what are the common stumbling blocks for both new and seasoned engineers that you didn't expect?",65,1976,9,343

(fair wanting that this may seem like /r/iamverysmart material)
at college, i've found most of my business school peers to be very different than myself and the group of friends i had always kept growing up. i really have not been challenged very much by the curriculum (my only b thus far came when i attempted to take an upper level foreign language course after not taking a class in it for 3 years). for example, many of my friends in the business school have talked about how hard intermediate accounting was this last semester. i finished with a 96 with fairly minimal studying.
 this is all well and good, but i can't help missing being one of the ""smart kids"". i often see many engineering students who can't make it in engineering switch to business, and worry that i'm seen as a lower-tier student.
in addition to this, as i look at potential careers or internships, many jobs will say they are looking for ""finance or other quantitative majors"", usually including engineering. i understand why many companies specify this, as they would prefer to hire a ""smarter"" person irregardless of background. given my status at a non-target university, ""high finance"" jobs""l (investment banking, private equity, etc) are all out of reach or could also be attained by an engineering grad with similar networking, etc. the jobs left seem to me to be carrying a high likelihood of being automated in near years. 
i've been mulling over a switch to majoring in engineering, even though it would mean adding at least a year to my degree and essentially throwing out everything i've done to this point. 
did anyone major in/pursue a career in engineering not because they were particularly drawn to it, but because it was the ""smart thing to do?"" if so, would you recommend a path like that?

i'm only a second year mechanical engineering student so apologies in advance if this is a dumb question or anything.

i was in an interview for an internship, and i was talking about one of my previous projects. the interviewer asked me a few questions including ""how did you determine where to put the bolts?"" and ""how did you determine bolt length?""

i've always just designed things and placed bolts ""intuitively"" if that makes sense, but these questions made me wonder if there is some sort of step-by-step official algorithm of sorts to determine bolt placement and stuff. i was wondering if someone on here could shed light on this.",45,649,8,109

i'm finishing bs in mechanical engineering, however specializing in thermal (might be different system in other countries). hvac is something i fell in love with as soon as i started studying it. my first project was calculating heat load of friend's building and for my diploma i'm making quite sweet excel worksheet for determining effect of unheated apartment(s) on apartment building and adjacent apartments. 

i'm trying to learn and follow as many standards as possible. and here it gets kind of silly.

recently i've been invited to work on a project. i did my calculations, followed needed standards to the point, but calculation was mainly done using iso 12831. exception were thermal bridges which i determined approximately based on other standard and ventilation based on common sense, while still following standard od course.

so after i handed in my calculations, i got feedback my numbers are 15% off - too low - comparing to that guy's calculations and experience. he's following way older standard which many people seems to use and it's most similar to fast calculation method iso 12831 offers, which is from my experience (project and diploma) quite off - can be up to 30% it seems. 

so naturally i started doubting in my calculations, even if i checked several times for any error. argument why it was wrong was that i took improper u-value for windows, even if i know which windows are installed, by logic that gas leaks out and you should calculate worst scenario, which is in my opinion bullshit. other argument was that heat load through the floor isn't high enough because water might flow less than 1m below the house - more than 10°c below freezing point?

only thing i could think of is improper determination of thermal bridges, but standard provides good enough approximations that should, as i believe, be freely used in calculations and not give wrong numbers, if any give too high heat load result. 

ia there a possibility that my calculations are correct, but in practice old school people ""overdimension"" things in fear it might not work well enough? because they are used to it?

it makes me kind of scared if i'll work on a project alone that i'd screw things up and people would say ""hey, i'm cold in my house!"".

0,"Achieved my childhood dream of working in aerospace, and I’m not nearly as enthused on the other side...",1,173,84,1560909816,"achieved my childhood dream of working in aerospace, and i’m not nearly as enthused on the other side... for as long as i can remember, i’ve told pretty much everyone that i wanted to work in aviation/aerospace. last summer i got my first experience in the field through an internship, and even got to take some flying lessons on the side, which was an unforgettable experience. i still hope to obtain my ppl one day. 

in december i graduated with a bsee focusing in electromagnetics, and in february started working at a different aerospace company as an electromagnetic compatibility engineer. on paper, it’s everything my “dream” job ought to be. four months in, while i don’t hate it, i’m already realizing i don’t exactly want to be in this industry, nor work in the same role, my entire career.

to be clear, i have no doubt i’m getting good experience, and indeed, i’m using quite a bit of knowledge from my em and rf clases. i've already gained a ton of practical knowledge of emc in aerospace just in a few months. my coworkers are nice and very knowledgeable, there’s some business travel associated with my job, and so far i’d like to think i’ve done a decent job of learning the ropes of what is generally considered a pretty niche field - even if i don't want to stay in it for too long.

but as i was warned about plenty of times as a student, the industry is very bureaucratic, with a seemingly endless list of standards and other technical documentation to follow for everything. don’t get me wrong, i appreciate why all of it’s necessary for safety, and absolutely respect the work of those engineers who spend their entire careers in emc. regardless, at the end of the day, even if i’m working around some amazing aircraft, the role doesn’t leave me feeling extremely satisfied or motivated purely out of passion. the office environment was also a somewhat jarring transition, and i'm still ambivalent as to how i feel about the routine of working 9-5. i miss the flexibility of university and having friends in such close proximity, but the freedom outside of work to pursue other non-engineering interests cannot be understated.

anyways, my exit plan is to pursue my masters abroad in the latter half of next year, which i went into some detail [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/askengineers/comments/b0h73v/is_wanderlust_a_good_enough_reason_to_pursue_a/). i tell myself that everything i’m doing now - saving money, gaining relevant experience, learning my target languages, etc. - is a relatively short-term sacrifice in order to achieve that goal. in the meantime, i'm trying my best to keep other hobbies alive, and maintain a somewhat active social life.

so, r/askengineers, what advice would you give someone in my situation? if y’all have similar personal experiences, especially with aerospace, i would be happy to hear them. did you change to a different role in the same industry, or change industries altogether? were you ever worried about being pigeonholed?

i recently started an internship at a nasa center. i was very excited to come work here for the summer until i learned that i was working with nasa contractors far away from the main buildings on site. i work in a small building with some contractors and blue collar workers. nasa owns the building and only a select few offices were given to the contractors. 

&#x200b;

the problem is that i currently have no work and the room they put me in is a computer server room, and it is very, very loud in here. the computers are always making this loud ass beeping noise and i can't focus on anything. i barely can type out this post. i have a nice pair of bose headphones (the qc35-ii) and i can still hear the damn computer unless i have my headphones at 100% volume.

i have asked to be moved, but because of ""reasons"" they can't move me anywhere else. even though they're plenty of desks in other rooms in the building, the contractors weren't assigned these rooms and so i can't even go in there and ask to sit at that desk? i don't report to anyone here, that's just what the co worker who has been helping me out told me.  what irritates me the most is that there is a conference room that no one uses that is very quiet and last friday, when almost no one was here, i just moved my computer over and sat in there and worked in peace for the day, but when i asked if i could work there full time, my co worker said no. i kinda think that it's bull that they can't move me.

how dumb would it be to have, what i am tentatively naming, a ""different engine ratio process"" (derp) where, say, the driver side engine bank has pistons that are 9.5:1 and the passenger side is 8.5:1.

for further complication, the driver side would drive a large turbocharger and the passenger side a small one. the charge air output from both would be combined, for a parallel turbo setup. by ""large"" i mean only somewhat larger, relative to the other turbo.

the goal is not to have better turbo response at any rpm, or efficiency, or any of the regular reasons for fitting a turbo. it's just to see if it would a) work, and b) possibly sound cool.

other thoughts: would an ecu capable of individual bank/cylinder fueling/spark control, and for bonus points, different cam grinds *per bank*.

devil's advocate: i'm guessing the compression ratios and turbo sizes involved would not be different enough to really be able to tell/feel a difference. it would just be a lot of work for a less fast/more explody engine that doesn't sound any different.",59,1155,8,199

i will be finishing school after this fall semester, with a ba in me. i am working an internship this summer with the same company, for the second time. it has gone extremely well and we get along great, really could not have asked for more. i have many years management experience (i am 31, so not your typical college student) from a job i worked at for 9 years before this. i will ultimately be in charge of a lot of the operation of the plant (including the people), maintenance of machines/plant and continued development of new machines. the owners of the offered me a job prior to this summer and told me if anyone else offers something, they will match or exceed the offer.

 it is a unique job in the sense that there will be one engineer (me) once their current engineer retires in the next couple years. they are in the farming industry and build and design nearly everything from scratch, from forklifts to spray rigs to hoists for shop etc. i am a certified welder, very proficient on machines (lathe, mill, etc) and can fabricate well enough where they just hand me plans from current engineer and i will get it done. all of the background, now to my question.

we are going to finalize the deal next week concerning pay and those details. they told me to tell them how much i wanted per hour (we agreed hourly was the best way at this point) and it would probably be fine. being they/we are ag, you do not get ot until after 50 or 60 hours. the typical work week is 47-50 hours and for 10 weeks straight during harvest, expectation is 7 days a week/12 hours a day for those 10 weeks (ot and dt). i have a friend who got hired locally within the last couple months for a different company at $37 an hour (40 hr workweek) and i feel i am worth at least that. the part that has me pause, is with all the extra hours i will be working, that yearly salary gets pretty high (great for me right?). i do not feel i should discount my worth due to the extra hours, because they want me to work extra... i also really respect these people and enjoy being here so i do not want to seem greedy. advice? ps i am in ca",37,2236,5,423

here’s the idea:

1. gravel road costs $1.30-$1.70 a sq foot

2. a $1.50 a sq foot would buy mid grade quality gravel road

3. make the road 20 feet wide for 10 feet unmarked for each direction of the road.

0,How to work less hours?,1,320,229,1559045580,"how to work less hours? i feel like i'm losing my mind

i was poor growing up and my father worked 60+ hour weeks cleaning shit out of portable toilets for us to get by. (mother disabled).

he always told me to work smart not hard. get an education so you don't have to work long shitty (pun?) hours like i do to survive.

so i did, and i now have an extremely well paid engineering job (computer engineering in finance). in my five years since graduating i've managed to pay off all my debts and save up $100k in savings+401k.

i am finally at the place where i am not working to pay off someone else - i am not working because i _need_ my next paycheck. i am only working to provide for monthly expenses which i have covered with plenty to spare.

my father has since been promoted in his company and now has a cozy office position working 40 hours a week making enough money for him and my mom. once he could make more money he decided to work less hours.

my current company requires me to work 45 hours a week. after five years of working for them and making more money than i need i decided i wanted to cash in on my 'smart work' and work less hours each week - just 40 hours.

i offered to them that i would take the pay cut of ~11% to go down from 45 to 40 hours. i would continue to complete the same work in the same amount of time. win-win right? they save money and i save time?

my company said no way.

i then offered to go hourly. lose benefits + 401k and take a pay cut down to 40 hours per week.

my company still said no way.

this is where i am losing my mind. so every year you are going to give me a raise+bonus and pay me more and more money to do the same work for you. but you won't let me do the same work for less money?

i know what they want me to do - i see it all over the company. they want me to buy a luxury car, have some kids, all while taking on more responsibility at work. five years from now they want me to be a manager making even more money than i do now working 50+ hours a week.

that is insane. i have the money i need. if you give more money i'm not going to buy more stuff. more money doesn't shorten my commute. more money doesn't give me time with my family and friends. no one wishes they spent more time at work on their deathbed.

i make enough money where i could work half the hours i do now and still get by. and i would love to work ~20 hours a week.

my whole life i've been told the more money you make the less time you _have_ to work.

was this a lie? i'm losing my mind. working 45 hours a week for the rest of my life is fine if that's what i need to pay my bills. but i'm not going to work 45 hours each week just to build up a bank account.

i was learning a lot but i was also messing quite a bit along the way. within the lab there was the lab supervisor (who would usually be in the lab every other few weeks because he would fly a lot), the lab manager and me. so i only was able to turn to the lab manager for help most of the time.

as my time went on i noticed myself making a lot of mistakes because a lot of different products would come into the lab and each product requires a different type of test and procedures which means i’d have to learn something new. then when that product would come back in another two months i’d have to try to remember every or ask my boss again. he eventually got me a notebook to write everything i need to remember in, that’s how much i needed to remember. sometimes my boss would get angry if i ask about something that i should “already know the answer to”. my internship basically felt like another extremely hard class that i was afraid of failing. sometimes my boss would tell me that it’s okay to mess up because he’d see how frustrated i’d be once i get lectured on something again. he told me that he’s messed up in every way possible so that gave me some comfort. it was just very annoying to experience all the mess ups and self doubts. being there felt discouraging and i left with less confidence.

0,Where is the technical work in manufacturing engineering?,1,20,27,1558993387,"where is the technical work in manufacturing engineering? i'll start with a simple question and then divulge: where on the manufacturing side of a factory is there technically challenging engineering work? assembly? primary manufacturing? it just depends?...

&#x200b;

to divulge a bit: i'm a bsme senior graduating in december on my third and final internship. my last two were in design and i got very good experience with technical, meaningful projects. this summer however, i took a manufacturing engineering internship with a major heavy equipment manufacturer, and to say the least, i'm very disappointed so far.  


i'm in the ""primaries"" department, meaning we make parts out of raw sheet steel with the use of laser cutting and press brake operations. i thought this experience would be very interesting and, if nothing else, would help me be a better design engineer. it likely will help give a new perspective, but i feel very led on by my recruiters/supervisor. the offer and conversations that followed sounded like the position would include technical work and that i would help implement brand new laser cells featuring a bunch of newer automation technology. sounds pretty interesting, right? 

&#x200b;

what they didn't tell me is that my supervisor and all the other ""me's"" in our group don't actually have engineering degrees. this is fine with me, but what i'm concerned about is the lack of technical projects they work on. it really seems like their job is more of just managing the shop floor and fixing issues the floor workers run into. the automation they plan on bringing in to the factory will likely be over a year out, and there isn't much work to do in the meantime regarding that change. so after one week, i haven't been given any meaningful projects and from talking with guys around the office, it doesn't sound like there are any pressing projects for me to get involved with. i will press my supervisor this week for more information on projects and needs of the group, and let it be known that i want to take on responsibility and be challenged.

&#x200b;

overall i'm just really surprised how little ""actual engineering"" work they do, and wonder if things are much different in other manufacturing areas like assembly? at this point i'm just kicking myself for not taking one of the design offers i turned down for this ""diverse experience"". as someone who knows very little on the manufacturing side of things, i would really appreciate some insight on where or if there is more technically challenging and exciting work. hopefully things will turn around and the summer will go well, but i just don't see it so far with this group...",57,2631,8,440

other than generally having more responsibility and marginally higher pay than a non-senior engineer, is there much difference?  if i’m coming into a company from the outside, the title doesn’t really change much for me with my salary expectations.  i’m going to ask for what i’m going to ask for and if they’re willing to pay it they’ll hire me.  honestly, i’d rather hire into a non-senior position so there’s more opportunity for promotion in the future.

i'm  going in to my senior year of me undergrad. i'm doing an internship at a large defense contractor and i'm enjoying it, but i can't see myself working in defense for the rest of my life. this internship lasts until i graduate, at which point the majority of people get full time offers. since this company pays 100% of our graduate tuition, i plan on immediately pursuing my masters. my school offers two me tracks: one focusing in thermofluids, and one focusing in mechanical systems (which i would tailor to be more focused on mechatronics / controls / electromechanical systems). i really love all things related thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. because of this, for a while i thought i wanted to be a propulsion engineer. however i'm realizing that defense isn't a very glamorous industry, and that leaves me with very limited options for propulsion. i'm not sure where else i would go with thermofluids. hvac seems boring. energy / power systems could be very interesting, but i'm not sure what these industries look like and they will evolve in the coming years.

on the other hand, i took a controls course this past semester and loved it. so much so, that i bought an arduino kit and i've been having a blast with it. i love working with sensors and actuators, and the logic behind control systems is incredibly interesting to me. so now i'm having second thoughts about thermofluids, and thinking that mechatronics and controls wouldn't be half bad. my concern though, is that it seems like mechanical engineers could have a limited role in mechatronic systems from the control aspect. ee / cs guys could probably make a much better control system than i ever could, and the last thing i want to do is work on the structures of a mechatronic system.

i just graduated from a top ten university with a degree in chemical engineering. sounds great, right? well...i graduated with a 2.21 gpa (2.43 major). zero internship experience. spent most of my semesters on academic probation. took 6.5 years to graduate.

to be blunt, i'm not hireable. no company in the world could look at my academic record and choose to give me a shot. i know that, and i recognize that engineering simply isn't an option for me at this point.

with that said, what *are* the options for someone like me? i don't want to work a minimum-wage job the rest of my life, like i have been full-time since graduating, and i have to believe it's possible to find some job somewhere that i could be qualified for. or become qualified for.

what should someone in a situation like mine do?*

i appreciate any and all insight.

*i don't want to make this question specific to me, but rather broadly applicable to anyone whose undergraduate experience was, to put it mildly, an unmitigated disaster. i'm happy to answer questions about my specific situation, but i want to keep the situation generalizable for everyone.


**addendum:** i don't want to portray myself as completely hopeless. yes, my overall gpa is dire, but the context is that i ""earned"" a 1.42 gpa during my freshman year, and subsequently took two years off to take community college courses before returning. with the exception of a semester that proved to be almost a total loss (1.37 gpa and two d's; i should have dropped out of classes before the deadline), i earned a 2.44 gpa or higher in my other 5 semesters, and a 2.82 and 3.20 in my final two semesters, respectively (while working 20+ hours per week during both semesters). so it's not a complete wash. but it's very hard to be optimistic... i have a friend who enjoyed a full ride to michigan, earned a 3.95 gpa, and worked multiple internships...and he applied to 60 jobs with only 2 interviews!",112,1955,16,336

&#x200b;

background: i'm a white male, upper middle class, and i have engaged in moderation for most of my life. i exercised four days a week, drank one day a week, and ate mostly healthy and organic the rest of the time. in 2012 -2013 my life was nearly perfect. i had a good job, owned a home, was a good parent, was in good physical condition, and was dating an amazing woman. everything was looking up. i would routinely do hours long workouts with heavy weight, run 3-5 miles, and go out to socialize when i wasn't raising my daughter or working on projects. 

&#x200b;

in that time frame everyone at work started noticing strange smells, and the office became oppressive. i work in an office environment built within older manufacturing space, and had since 2006. the office has an attached paint shop. at first we suspected the paint shop was the culprit, but often the shop would be inactive when the strange smells occurred, and everything had been fine for years. we constantly complained about the environment after then. it grew steadily worse. the temperature would rise to almost 90 degrees sometimes, but for some reason we would not sweat. it was almost like our skin was being coated with a waterproofing agent. it was hard to breathe sometimes. people began to experience mood swings, confusion , cognitive issues in general, nerve symptoms, panic attacks, rashes, spots on their skin, tumors, cancer (5 men with prostate cancer in the room i worked in - most below 50), spontaneous abortion, constant infections (one person i know had phneumonia from the day he started until the day he left), lethargy, exhaustion (chronic fatigue), spinal problems (three people required the same spinal surgery - all sat within ten feet ), vision problems, bleeding, infections, an intoxicated feeling, flushed skin. i could go on. at one point my feet were bleeding and i felt like i had bugs all over me. the thing seemed to follow me home as well, as people who were in contact with me would occasionally have discomfort or strange issues as well. i realized after i left that i would relapse every time i wore my old shoes from the office. something is present. 

&#x200b;

we complained and contacted osha. they were useless. the management company diverted information and covered everything up. their testing showed that the environment is perfect. better than outside air. this even though we all had entire baggies full of crap that fell on our desks every day. they binder-clipped furnace filters over the vents. over christmas 2014 they removed all of the air handlers from the building and replaced with new. half million dollar units at least. we eventually found out that none of the doors in the air system had been working because the system was so full of moisture that it rusted. we had been getting no air. they tried to tell us that the black stuff on our desks was zinc from a rusting pan in the old air handler. they refuse to clean the ducts because they're full of fiberglass insulation. more tests came back perfect. osha wrote a letter scolding them for not posting any environmental info in the building. not testing. the letter disappeared. i was leaving the building by then but everyone still reported a terrible environment. we contacted niosh. they informed me that all of the complaints had disappeared. it was just me and one other person. the management company came down to actively intimidate people who had filled out complaints. my manager tried to advocate for me. thank god for that. i was barely functional by then. i would get lost in my own house. confusion. weakness. everyone told me how healthy i was. but i wasn't. that was all years ago. doctors have been useless. worse than useless. i was in y middle 30's when this started. the refrain was ""you're getting on in years pal."" idiotic. so many of us were athletes. i sat next to an olympic alternate for crying out loud. the government has failed. they won't even respond to emails. now here we are. 

i need to know what to test for. how to test for it. i need a leg to stand on. does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? how can i get our water tested for something i don't know? our building sits adjacent to (or on) a huge man made pond which has been used for drainage. i know for a fact that this pond is drenched in insecticide and herbicide to keep it mostly clear. i know for a fact that the company allowed a large diesel spill to make it's way into this pond recently - and probably has in the past. could this be a soil vapor issue? they tested for voc inside the building and i have since learned that this isn't correct. they're supposed to dig holes and test. recently they smoke tested the sewers and the building filled with smoke. could vapors be making their way up the sewer from the neighboring (abandoned) industrial areas? can this be toxic gas from mold? there are lots of psychiatric effects to be seen. the once-happy and close office became a wasteland of nervous, paranoid, twitchy, angry people. lives have been ruined. and now they want me to train kids to sit in that area.  

please help. if you have any expertise whatsoever. tell me what to do and i'll try it. we can' make them change anything without evidence. and now they're building a daycare across the street. what if this is in the water? what if it's pfas or something like that? how would i even find out? the company refuses to test the water. can this be from a leak in the air handler radiators? i heard some contractors talking about how they had put fifty gallons of something into the system recently and it was gone?

if you are done reading all of this and you are going to comment that it's totally normal to have all this happen. that cancer clusters are natural. that it's really all in our heads. please don't. the statistical probability of more than one man under 40 having prostate cancer adjacent to the other is tiny. add to that more cases and it's just impossible. just move on. i'm looking for actionable advice and suggestions from professionals familiar with the equipment and standards. thank you all for reading this far! god bless.",59,7198,7,1281

we have two interns right now. both have degrees and i believe they only took internships because they couldn’t find engineering jobs before their graduation. one of them is really really good. the other is competent, but doesn’t shine like the first. both have been given positive reviews to management, but i think the first one stands out as a must-hire.

i have already told management that both are good, but one is better. i think they’re both in a horrible spot working as interns despite having degrees, and i would never have wanted to be in that situation myself, and took the first opportunity i had to get out of it, when i was. what i would like to do is firstly make sure that the more talented intern gets what she deserves salary-wise (even if that means going to another company). secondly, i want to pressure my management not to low-ball her, because she’s worth the money, and i feel like she is insulted daily with her hourly rate, and wouldn’t accept another insult like that. and in my experience, that’s exactly what my company does.

what i am considering doing is to ask her what her baseline is, and then tell management to offer slightly more than that, even if it costs us the opportunity to hire the other intern. i’m afraid management is going to try to hire both, and lowball them both, and then get neither, or only the less competent one. and while that one might be fine, the other would be much more valuable.

i truly don’t have any power in the situation, other than how management values my opinion. i have been told that they do, so i want to use that power to ensure we are able to build & afford the best possible team. in the long run, i feel that’s more important than anything else, including my own compensation. so that leads me to my questions...

should i directly ask her how much she wants? what if that creates an expectation and then management can’t do that and attempt to hire both? unfortunately i believe they’ve both been told that management wants to hire them, if possible. so what if that means the other never gets an offer? i would definitely feel bad, especially since the first would know that to afford her, we couldn’t hire the other. they are friends and i think that she would feel bad about it. do i just tell her that part to get her to come down on her minimum? i’d really like to give her what she wants, if possible...

i just feel like it’s a tough situation and that we’re going to get screwed by management and lowball them both instead of offering the better candidate what she’s worth.",34,2685,6,483

california. i’m at the end of my fourth quarter but taking one extra quarter in the fall to finish up, so i’ll be a student until the end of december. i’m not taking the extra quarter due to failed classes, but due to time restrictions (internship, leadership positions in clubs, etc.)

i’ve worked as a land development intern for ten months at a firm. the vice president called me in the other day and told me he doesn’t think the company will hire me, mainly due to the fact that they hired three fresh-out-of-college engineers last year. he said they’re looking for someone with some more experience. i have a good relationship with my bosses, and it’s a great internship that i’ve learned a lot at. 

that being said, he thought this was my last quarter, and held off telling me this until i potentially would’ve been 5 weeks away from graduation. he said i can stay on as an intern until december.

that being said, would it be better to find another company to work for? there’s some openings at several good, well-respected firms for an entry level engineer, and i already meet all the requirements (civil 3d experience, familiar with the processes, fe), with the exception of having my actual degree. i’m considering letting these other companies know i’d be willing to be an intern while they train me during the on-boarding process, which (i’m assuming) might be appealing to them as it wouldn’t cost them as much. i’m basically willing to be an intern for these companies until i get my actual degree.

this is all triggered by the r/all lpt, that if i’m looking for a job or considering changing, that i shouldn’t tell my employer. if i do look for this other job, should i keep it a secret? or let my boss know?

their hiring process here takes a while, so i was offered a temporary contract position which i accepted.  when i was brought on i was told it would only be a few weeks to transition to a permenant position, but you guessed it... sudden hiring freeze.  so they can renew my contract when it's up in 2 months, but i have no eta on getting in permenant.

first - phd in process control working funded by a large company and at my home city university where i have studied my undergraduate degree

second - graduate engineering role in renewable energies sector (mostly lithium-ion battery technology) at a large research institution that is connected to a university in a different city than my home city. 

i think i would enjoy both positions and both are quite technically challenging and research driven positions. although the job offer would pay more than the stipend i would receive for my phd, money for the next few years isn't really my main concern as a graduate engineer and i value job satisfaction and my future career path over the short-term.

my main consideration is the future prospects of the two different industries. to my knowledge, control engineering is kind of ubiquitous and there's also a good chance i will get offered a job after by the company funding the research. on the other hand, the energy industry is obviously going to be extremely dynamic in the next few decades as we (hopefully) make the switch to renewables and it would be a rewarding career path.

my secondary consideration is moving away (about 2 hours) for the graduate job role. would it be worth moving for this opportunity? i know the likelihood is i will have to move at some point in my career, but at this point i am worried about the risk i am taking by moving to a different part of the country for a job.

i am a 2nd year me student and have been debating about obtaining a graduate degree. specifically this is to do r&d in automotive and possibly tech fields.

&#x200b;

the problem is managing between heavy fsae commitment and getting grades. my school is pretty industry-oriented with 6 coops during the degree, which results in most focusing on obtaining better coops. either focus on fsae and get better coops, which gets you a better job later on or focus on school, sacrificing the fun and incredibly useful skills. 

&#x200b;

i am definitely not trying to obtain a master's just to tick a box. i have worked at r&d labs and would love to do develop a project/thesis on vehicle dynamics/controls. fsae has also been invaluable to me and i owe it pretty much every useful skill.

unfortunately my grades have been not stellar (sub 3.0) and although i seem to excel in research environments (colleagues' feedback) there is no guarantee that i will obtain an extremely high gpa.

""my skills in solidworks are good, and i'm a smart kid. but i don't have enough experience. i know how sheet metal works, but i have little design experience and with the pay, they want an experienced sheet metal designer.""

i made 22 an hour. btw i'm 23, with no degree, i have 2/3 of a me degree, i'm working my to get experience and pay my way. i knew i was learning and improving quickly, as it's been less than a week. first time i've been let go from anywhere, because i was not a experienced enough. even with a degree, there was no way i'd be better off doing that job, in my opinion, and 22 an hr is not allot of money. i made some mistakes filling out the paperwork a 2-3 times. and once on my second day, a dimension was wrong on a print. all caught before it hit the floor and welding. but that's about it. is that acceptable?",42,2398,9,457

It is making me crazy,1,76,65,1555883099,"do you really use creo? it is making me crazy i am dealing with a final project in a design elective i am being required to use creo. i've used solidworks and ansys extensively for the last 3 years. while i can see that creo has strengths in analysis and that in comparison it appears to be a light weight program that runs better on older machines. i am, however, seriously questioning the assumption that anyone would actually want to use this program. modeling parts, even simple parts, is a nightmare.

i have now lost days fighting how creo wants to do a helical sweep. in drawing the pattern creo will always assume the incorrect direction for the sweep and prevent the sweep from happening. worse, it is not possible to actually edit the few models i have, some how, made that the sweep worked once the analysis shows that thread and rod will require dimensional changes. the process of making this simple part is not repeatable in creo.

in any other program i have used this would be a quick change, the model would rebuild and if there are errors i can fix it. creo on the other hand, is the worst thing i have ever had the displeasure of working with. made a mistake, changed your mind, the analysis says that something needs to change... completely start over. nothing is salvageable and nothing is simple or intuitive even to someone that is not exactly new to cad work. what does it matter if creo is supposedly better at large assemblies if making parts is a complete disaster?",45,1446,10,257

-i did not do any summer internships (summers were full of retaking classes)
-2.49 gpa
-senior project was a bit of a flop, i almost did not graduate because of it
-didn't take the fe exam my senior year when everyone else was (senior project was killing me)

i’m a design engineer at a sheet metal fab company, and our big project right now is a large automated material selection tower. basically, we have a tower which has shelves into which steel pallets (which hold metal sheets) are fed by a crane. 

right now, i’m trying to decide on the gd&t tolerance for perpendicularity of the shelves with respect to the upright frame... these shelves are welded on to the tower frame, and if they are welded off-kilter, then they can be sloped downward too much, and the pallet carrying 800lbs of steel can fall off and kill somebody. so my idea is to calculate the slope at which the pallet will begin to slide, and base my tolerance around that.

thing is, the pallets are painted and varnished, while the shelves are unfinished angle iron. i know i’m going to need to use friction coefficients, but i’m not sure which coefficient to use, or how to find the “effective” coefficient.

obviously there are other solutions aside from spending such time on tight gd&t controls, like measuring for levelness after fab and shimming appropriately, but my boss likes us to be very thorough and not “mickey mouse” projects.

my phone fell into this deep narrow space. it's 1.5m deep, 30cm across and about 1cm wide. there are walls on the sides so it's similar to a box. one of the walls is angled so as it goes deeper down, it gets narrower. here's a picture to reference: http://imgur.com/gallery/r7rnxiv

things i've tried:

1. tried to hook up my phone as it has a small loop of string attached to it, but it was really hard to as there's hardly any light going down into it. shining a torchlight into another phone doesn't work either, though i miraculously managed to get a photo.

2. tried to use two wider tape measures to try to pull it up (due to the l shape), but i found out about the angled wall.

here are some suggestions you guys suggested, but i ran into a bit of trouble.

1. many of you guys suggested to use wire hangers and i do have them, but have no idea how to use them to retrieve my phone. :-( also the depth is pretty deep at 1.5m, so that's a problem.

2. some also suggested to use string to loop over the phone and pull it up but it's really hard to do given the lack of light.

3. about using tape and dragging it up against the wall: tried this, but tape kept getting itself stuck onto the surface of the walls.

4. i don't have mercury. (lol)

i know this may be a very lengthy post and i really do hope that i don't come off as being too demanding or anything. i really thank all of you for having given me valuable input! i'll be able to try and get it out again next week so any advice before then is gladly welcome! thanks in advance!",47,1793,9,313

0,How to go about quitting a team you are a vital member of?,1,18,18,1554487327,"how to go about quitting a team you are a vital member of? a little background, overall i like the people i work with and my boss, however i don't particularly like my job. we are working on a smallish project that is vital to the company's future. i have been with the company for 3 years and at the beginning of the year transitioned to a role where i support this project full time, where for the previous 8 months or so i was doing my normal job as a production engineer and lending my time to this project. presently i am the only local engineering support for the project. we have technical support in another state and the project manager lives in a third state. there are other people onsite supporting the project who are very experienced in this technology, just none of them are engineers.

there are a few reasons that i want to quit. the first is that i am just not happy in my location. i have been here 8 years now and we have been feeling for a while like it is time for me and my wife to move on. i would like to live in a place that facilitates our hobbies, which my current location doesn't. my company has only one location that i would consider moving to, but that leads to my next point. if i were to stay with the company and move to this location i would probably have to move into a technical support role, which i initially thought i wanted as my career path, however, if i did that i would likely support the same technology for my entire career until either it is phased out or i retire. the idea of that is pretty depressing to me. i am not particularly passionate about what we make and i feel like there is something better that i could be doing. in other words, i am just not happy with my prospects here or elsewhere with my company. 

i am also awaiting a decision regarding my application to a master's program that i would pursue online while i continue my work. if i get in, upon completion i would likely change fields. 

the current plan has the project completing at the end of 2019, however, i think that is too optimistic and projects in my company tend to take longer than they are planned. 

the timeline that i am looking at is sticking around, supporting the project, and then quitting around this time a year from now when my wife completes her doctorate. best case scenario, the project is returned to operations between late 2019 and early 2020 and there is minor post work that needs to be addressed and then i can be honest with my boss about my intentions to leave, find a location that i am happier in, and find work in my future field. however, i am far more concerned about the worst case scenario, where the project is delayed and i will be looking to leave before the project is completed. the local and remote support would be able to carry out the project to completion, but i am already feeling some strange pre-guilt about the concept.

has anyone been in a similar situation? can anyone help me navigate this complicated situation?",58,2934,13,544

like suppose i want to bolt two pieces together with two bolts and have the bolts be an inch apart from each other. i know i can look up what the bolt hole size needs to be and select the proper drill size to make that hole and there's not much i can do to affect the tolerance on the hole size (other than using different drill sizes for tight or free fits).

but for the distance between the two bolts, what do i set that tolerance as? in this particular case, i don't much care whether the bolts are exactly 1in apart, just that the holes line up with each other and hold the parts together. i guess in general i'm supposed to decide how much margin is acceptable in each dimension. i'm not making a ton of the same parts here, so i don't really care about the statistics side of this at all. but i have no idea how to answer the question ""how far out of alignment is ok for two holes with a bolt running through them?"" or how to do so in an ""engineer-y"" way. 

this is especially confusing as there's some amount of ""tolerance"" that also then just a design choice. like if i've got a mounting plate and it doesn't matter if it's 3/8in or 1/2in or even 1in thick, it will still do the job. but it seems really weird to put ""3/4 +- 0.25in"" on a drawing. it just seems way too big. or if i have two pieces that need to match in a specific way (like hole patterns) but the specifics of that is up in the air (doesn't matter if the holes are 1in or 1.5in apart).

last thought is on repeatability. by that i mean, if i loosen the bolts, jiggle it around, and re-tighten them, how far will the parts have moved from each other? i imagine that this would effect not just the design (fit level for the holes) but also the tolerance. is this something i can design for?

first, over the last 10 days, the missouri river near omaha, nebraska has averaged about [150,000 cubic feet per second flow rate](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ne/nwis/uv?cb_00010=on&cb_00060=on&cb_00065=on&format=gif_default&site_no=06610000&period=&begin_date=2019-03-10&end_date=2019-03-24).

an area 3 miles by 3 miles, that's been slightly dug down and built up around the perimeter to give a potential depth of 36 feet would provide enough volume to hold a lot(7 days at 15,000 cf/sec) of water. enough to absorb 10% of the river flow for 1 week. given that the top of the river is currently higher than 36 feet, it would require no pumping, and when the river water level recedes, the retention pond just could be opened back up to later release the water back into the river.

it seems like to me that this could be pretty useful in reducing the water level in the river enough to prevent a significant amount of flooding.

i know certain areas along the missouri/mississippi rivers are designated for intentional emergency flooding(the atchafalaya basin for example), but people also live and work in that area. however, i'm not aware of any specially-built areas meant exclusively for water retention in flood times like this, which makes me think it must not be practical/possible.

at this internship i’ve been doing design, design reviews, validating concepts, and a lot of embedded programming, which was all new to me (platforms, tools, environment).  it has been a really great experience and i have really appreciated it and learned a lot.  i think i’ve been performing well enough (no official review from my manager yet), but there is one thing i’ve noticed about myself that isn’t a technical know-how issue but more of a personality thing.

i’ve done mistakes as all interns do, but i aways feel extremely guilty and start feeling bad about these.  i guess it might be imposter syndrome but every time i make one (soldering a new chip on a board and the board stops working, over-engineering a problem when i realized i wasn’t connected to the right pin after a week, feeling like it’s taking me too long to program a driver for a certain chip, etc.), i just can’t seem to shake it off and i just finish work feeling off.  

i’m looking for some advice on how to stop beating myself up for these.  what do you guys do and how do you guys handle mistakes?",46,1350,8,240

0,BSME in HVAC looking to maximize income.,1,48,29,1553193557,"bsme in hvac looking to maximize income. hi everyone,


i graduated 9 years ago with a bsme. did a lot of different types of entry level engineering jobs, from component engineering to facilities engineering in a semiconductor facility, to transmission line maintenance engineering support. i've never really developed one specialization or distinctive career path. rather, i've been content with jon hopping, trying out different industries to see what appeals to me, and taking time between jobs to travel and lead what i consider is a fulfilling life to date.


i'm beginning to settle down a bit more now (i'm 30), and landed a job at a massive engineering firm doing hvac design engineering on projects for major clients with complex facilities (semiconductor, pharma, data centers etc). i actually find it pretty interesting even though i'm essentially starting as a newbie and have tons to learn.


my personal goals, however, do not include dedicating my life to becoming a top hvac engineer. in the last couple years i've realized i am more motivated by money than i had previously caeed to admit. i don't want a lot of it... just enough to be financially independent and, possibly, retire in 10 or so years (fire). but that means maximizing income now.


with that in mind, i'm looking for some guidance:


1. in the realm of hvac engineering, it seems like the real earning potential is in sales. am i correct in thinking this? yes, i know the life isn't for everyone, and your earnings are commission based. i actually like that idea. my pay is directly influenced by my effort. that motivates me. i also like interacting with people, meeting new people, and helping them solve problems. i thrive on that. so is technical sales something to try to get into for someone who is driven by optimizing income?


2. if sales is the way to go, i'm not going to find that at this company despite how much knowledge there is in the people here. however, i'm not going to get into an hvac sales role elsewhere without some sort of related experience. that is something i can get here. what sort of things should i be looking to absorb maximum knowledge from while at this company in order to give me a good baseline for an entry commercial hvac sales position in 2 or so years?

situation: lately after meeting with some of my coworkers and afterwards when we plan to go our own ways i’ve noticed a trend. the first time was with two guys, boss 1, and me. boss 1 shook both their hands and when i went to shake his hand he ended up making a hug out of it. then today it was boss 2, one guy, and me. boss 2 shook the hand of the guy and when i went to shake his hand it turned into a hug. this happened both before and after the meeting with him. 

i know both of my bosses, i’ve worked with them for a while, i know they don’t mean anything sexual or inappropriate, i know that hugging is culturally more common here then other places, etc. they are genuinely very decent and lovely humans and they have always been very respectful to me when other men have not in both work and academic settings. and being a tall blonde 20 something girl in engineering i’ve gotten a lot of shit over the years. i know it isn’t coming from a man in power or whatever. but i’m the only girl and i’m the only one getting hugs. and this only started once i stopped being a student. so i don’t know how to navigate this? it’s a professional setting and these are coworkers so is hugging a complete no? but it’s a lowkey company so very is the cultural location a valid excuse? should i stop it? should i just deal with it until i leave in july? is this something i will encounter for the rest of my career? i would love any feedback and thoughts or even personal experiences from both men and women!

it makes no sense why he hasn’t gotten at least a few interviews. he’s ridiculously intelligent, personable, organized, very hard working, has leadership skills and research experience. i just don’t understand why he isn’t being considered for jobs and it’s paining me to watch him lose hope in getting a job. 

i already have an internship offer and he deserves one more than me. i also helped him work on his resume in the hopes that rewording it would make it scan better. he’s tried writing cover letters too. 

the only thing i can think of is that maybe he’s one of those students who seems “too good” or “too smart” so companies assume he’ll just be going to grad school and isn’t a good choice for a program that prepares interns for a full time job.

i really want to help him but i don’t know what else to tell him at this point. not trying to job hunt for him or get resume tips, i’m just at a loss. any input at all is welcome and appreciated.

i’ve got a bs in mech eng and currently pursuing a general ms in mech eng. 

yesterday i was looking at how much work i had to do for one class in such a short time and all i could think to myself was “what’s the point of all this?”. i’ve written so many papers.

so to those that have an ms
1) was it worth it?
2) what’s the point of it?

background on me:
4 years out of college, been working for the navy for the last 2.5 years as a federal employee. got the masters to challenge myself and stay relevant, and also just to get it out of the way because this is a good time in my life (25m, not married etc etc)",31,820,7,162
0,Geotechnical engineering: Masters or PhD?,1,65,20,1552279546,"geotechnical engineering: masters or phd?  my girlfriend, 28, is a geotechnical engineer, currently in her first year of her master's degree. her graduate research focuses on liquefaction of silt soils.

she is starting to think about what she wants to do after the master's. the two options are:

**1) continue schooling and pursue a phd** (additional 3-4 years after masters) with the intent of joining the workforce after graduating. she *does not* intend to stay in academia after getting the phd. her main reason to get a phd is because she is interested in the subject matter (liquefaction) and enjoys her research.

or

**2) look for a job after the master's degree.**

there are several questions she's been trying to get information on:

1. in the geotechnical engineering field, does a phd give a significant edge over a master's in terms of salary? she understands that pursuing a phd has an opportunity cost of 3-4 years worth of master's level salary (minus the phd stipend that is paid).
2. in industry, how does a geotechnical engineer's job differ between those with master's degrees and phds?
3. does only having a master's limit her ability to become an ""expert"" in her field if she chooses to go into industry?
4. it seems like nowadays, a master's in geotechnical engineering is essentially required if you want to get an entry level job in geotechnical engineering. from what she's seen, geotechs with master's degrees are limited to density testing and other field observation type of work, whereas a geotech with a phd could start out directly doing design work. has this been your experience?
5. she enjoys her research, but has no intention of staying in academia if she gets a phd. does that limit her job prospects in industry significantly? she's worried that by getting a phd, she'll become overqualified for many geotechnical engineering positions. eventually, if she simply just needs to get a job out of finanical necessity, she wants to be marketable to a wide variety of positions, even if they're not ""ideal"".
6. she's 28 now. doing a phd would put her at graduating at 32-33 with her phd. financially, she has no debt at the moment, and hopefully wouldn't incur much debt during the phd (funding available). however, she'd like to start making some money, as she hasn't been able to really start saving toward retirement. what is your take on pursuing a phd with this in mind?
7. one of her goals is to be able to find jobs abroad (she loves to travel). between a master's or a phd, which is more condusive to accomplishing this goal (again, the phd would not be used for a job in academia).

thanks a lot. these are questions that we've been discussing and my background is me, so i can't speak to the geotechnical field.",41,2716,5,459

0,Can the floor of a school bus be replaced with wooden framing?,1,84,66,1552048314,"can the floor of a school bus be replaced with wooden framing? i am converting a used school bus to an rv and a portion of the existing floor is severely corroded and needs to be replaced. the original floor consists of folded 16ga steel sheets with additional stiffener channels on the bottom, with these sections welded together end-to-end and resting directly on top of the two c-beams of the bus chassis [this video shows how the floor is constructed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=sbcunucbesg#t=3m8s) (this is actually the exact make and model of my bus that they're building).

on the outer edges of this floor two steel pieces (they're a sort of beam without flanges) about 10"" high run front to back (this part is not really shown in the linked video or part 2) and are supported from underneath by the outside edges of the floor. the ribs (or ""channels"") that form the walls and the ceiling are welded to the outside of this piece (incidentally the out side of the seats are bolted to the tops of these pieces so they're often called the ""chair rail"" although they're more important structurally than just holding up the seats).

on my bus, unfortunately, the floor section around the wheel wells is severely corroded ([pics](https://imgur.com/a/yisoa9i) remember to cover your childrens' eyes). rust in this area is a common problem in school buses but this is a very severe example. the normal solution to this problem in the skoolie world is to sell the bus to someone who doesn't know any better and start over, but i want to at least try to do something about this as an experiment.

some skoolie owners who have faced this problem have rebuilt the floor with a 3"" steel tube frame covered with sheet metal welded on (3"" is about the height of the original floor so this brings it back to the same level). for reasons i'll mention below, i want to do the same thing except using pressure-treated wood. i would essentially remove the existing floor and run 4x4 beams from side-to-side just in front of and behind the wheel wells themselves and then another pair at the edges (front and back) of the wheel well floor panel, so the section (about 6' total) would be supported by four 4x4s that start underneath the chair rail on one side and run to the underside of the chair rail on the other side (so that these 4x4s would be sharing in the load of the walls and ceiling just like the rest of the floor). i would also frame out the small area between the wheel wells with 2x4s, but this of course would not support the walls the ceiling.

i don't know how to evaluated the bending strength of these existing floors, but would it be comparable to the bending strength of 4x4s space every foot and a half or two feet or so? the reason i want to use wood (instead of steel) here is that i can insulate the wood framing with polyiso foam board, so that in this area i would not have to build an insulated *sub*floor so i would gain an additional 3"" of interior height (i'm 6'1"" in shoes and the difference between a 6' interior height and 6'3"" is enormous).",62,3025,12,534

to address this problem, the mod team decided way back in 2014 to host a yearly thread to collect the experiences of engineers from various industries. this helps students learn what engineers do at work, and also gives engineers insight into what their counterparts do in other jobs/industries.

if you have any career-related questions, i highly encourage you to post them in the latest [*r/engineering weekly career discussion thread*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/search?q=flair%3a%22weekly+discussion%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) where engineers will give you advice and feedback on your job hunt if you ask for it. a new one is posted every monday morning.

the weekly thread is a good place if you:

  * need career advice, feedback on your résumé, or other career-related guidance
  * are asking about salary, job demand, switching industries, etc.
  * are a student asking about engineering majors and/or universities

&#x200b;

however, i got to participate in truly ground-breaking nanotech research my first year at the university (2012) and two internships, one in 2013 and 2014 for a petrochem fortune 400 company. i got to be there in a rare turnaround period for an old unit, work on high capital (300,000 and 220,000 dollar) projects working with re-designing ro unit configurations and alternate chemical suppliers. i met the ceo of the entire company and worked with him on safety training implementation, and even got to do some work with operators designing easier, more natural control systems.

&#x200b;

sounds really great from an employment perspective but this was all 5-6 years ago. i hit a rough time in my life where i  moved back home, became my grandmothers caretaker after her bout with sudden heart failure, and began doubting my abilities. my grades slipped, i lost my full-ride scholarship, and i fell into depression and thought about dropping out. i honestly should have to save my grades but the choice was more clear in hindsight. i at least built a business with my friend and sold it in this time but i doubt that makes up for much in employer's minds as anyone can have a friend say they did that together. 

  
i can explain away my long time to graduate and less than optimal gpa behind closed doors in an interview environment but at a career fair i dont know how to tackle this problem and even moreso dont know if internships and research from 5+ years ago is worth it if it reminds them how long ive been in school or is considered too long ago. any engineers out there sympathize with my situation and have some insight as to how i can tackle this?

hello,

i'm currently enrolled in college in the u.s. on a path to become an environmental or ecological engineer. one of my courses, microeconomics, has given me a career analysis assignment in which we investigate our chosen career's job growth, future potential, and day-to-day experiences and qualifications. one of the ways we acquire some of this information is through an interview with a person currently employed in our career choice. i have reached out to several engineering firms both local and national and have either received no response or not been able to be put into contact with an engineer. so, i decided to try to cut through the red tape and reach out directly to engineers through reddit at home, on their lunchbreaks, or sitting on the toilet. 

what i am looking for is an environmental or ecological engineer who can take the time to answer ten questions, possibly taking around 20-30 minutes to complete. i've received the ok from my instructor that no personal information need be passed around since we are operating through an internet forum. i apologize in advance for any gross formatting or rule violations, this being what i think is my first actual post on reddit. i did check the sidebar for past interviews however the questions i was provided with differ, and didn't want to sort of fudge that information just to fit in line with my questions. i wasn't positive on if those who volunteered in the 2018 list of engineers willing to be interview were still active, so thought i would cast a wider net with this post due to time constraint issues.

i have included the questions below. feel free to answer either through dm to me or right in the comments so others can read it. thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

interview questions--

job title:

1. what do you do in a typical day or week? how much time are you in meetings, on the phone, on the road, and working in teams versus working by yourself?

2. what kinds of decisions do you have to make? 

3. what skills are most critical to your success?

4. what personal qualities are important to being successful in this job?

5. what types of opportunities exist for advancement in this field? what are the keys to such advancement? 

6. what part of this job do you find most satisfying? 

7. what part of this job do you find most challenging?

8. how do you see jobs in this field changing in the future?

9. what special advice would you give to people entering this field/occupation?

up until this point in my life, my goal was to pursue a career in computer programming, but with no direct experience, other than my own software firm (rather unsuccessful at this point), and a felony conviction, i'm having trouble finding work. it occurred to me that i might find an easier shake in the industrial fields (factories, etc). and that's when it dawned on me to become a plc programmer. so i'm just looking for some advice on how hard the ground is in this field regarding past convictions. other than that, i'll share some other mitigating factors about my situation below. i appreciate any responses.  


1. my felony is second-degree assault in missouri. 
2. expungement is not an option.
3. my crime happened ten years ago.
4. it did not include theft, drugs, and given that it is second-degree, it was not premeditated. 
5. it was a fist fight. 
6. since that time, i've gone to school, started my own temporarily successful business, achieved many certifications and academic accolades. 
7. i never saw the inside of a prison cell, but was sentenced to probation.
8. i walked my probation in half the time i was supposed to be there, because it was deemed that i was in no way a danger to myself or others (good behavior).
9. besides this charge, i've never had even a speeding ticket. 
10. i have not re-offended in any way since the event.
11. i have letters of recommendation from clients, co-workers, teachers, and colleagues, attesting to my skills and sanity.
12. i have no tattoos, or piercings, and have a very large vocabulary (not bragging, this could be useful for demonstrating normalcy and intelligence). 

sorry about the length of the question, i just wanted to be thorough and honest. thanks again to any who take the time to respond to me. i appreciate it. ",64,2094,10,367

recently in a review my boss said i am a very good teacher but not a good manager. i need to give him a task and have him produce the results. the problem is this guy takes so long to get a job done that the deadlines get blown way out and i have to spend a bunch of extra time picking up his slack. i address these issues to the new engineer and he talks like he understands what i say but he does not put any of it in practice. he likes to talk about his philosophy on working all the time but i need him to understand that i don't care what his philosophy is, i just want him to work. he brags about working 12 hour days but doesn't understand that i don't care because i am getting the same amount of work done in 2 hours. i gave him some modeling work in sw that should've taken him maybe a day to finish. i did 75% of it and he needed to finish the last of it so i knew everything that was going on with it and what the task was at hand to get it completed. after 3 weeks he sends me incomplete work and then when confronted he gives me a bunch of attitude because his model failed and he thinks i fucked it up. he gives me excuse after excuse but i know all of the details, i knew that he had plenty of time to get it done. i knew the work was not complicated and used very basic technique. i knew the challenge was to interpret some of the customers design and make a few minor exception. nothing majorly risky but it was an opportunity for him to think critically about the problem and for him to think about what the customer requires and what our manufacturing techniques are capable of and make decisions. he did not show me he was remotely capable of it. he says he is struggling because he hasn't been given a project of his own yet and only been tasked with helping other people on their project but he hasn't been reliable with that work. he says the reliability issue is due to not have control of the situation and being to worried of not doing the work the way the other person wants it done. i think that's bullshit because the stuff he gets stuck on has nothing to do with that, he struggles to know what software to use or what basic processes to use. basically the reasons he thinks he is struggling is in reality not at all the truth and as much as i try to tell him and be nice and gentle about it, he won't hear it and comes up with his own excuses. i am about to be done being gentle with it because he is kinda on his last leg.

long story short.  i don't think this kid can cut it but i read horror stories of bosses expecting too much out of their people and not understanding the situation at hand. i am worried that i might be going too hard on this kid and i feel like an asshole. are there any techniques for when someone comes to you with a question that they should know the answer to and you tell them to go figure it out on their own but to do it in a way that is positive and motivates them? or when they aren't using the tools at hand properly, how i can get him to change the way he attacks work. i am losing my patience and faith in this kid but i don't want him to fail. i am out of ideas but i am new to this so i know i could be doing some things better or coming at this with a better approach.

0,Advice from experienced engineers?,1,100,57,1550762561,"advice from experienced engineers? hi everyone,

i’m hoping someone here can provide some insight. here’s some background:

i completed a bachelor’s degree in physics, and am now finishing my second year of an me phd program (which, upon completion of classes+the qualifying exam, i earn a concurrent master’s as well). 

my dissertation work is biomechanics focused, particularly modeling and simulation of gait disorders, with applications in the development of predictive and subject-specific rehabilitation programs. 

ideally, i’d like to work in industry after finishing my phd. i like biomechanics/modeling dynamic systems, but i’m not even sure what’s out there in terms of industry, or where/how to look for anything, or if it’s even going to be possible to get an industry job without a post doc or any experience outside of my dissertation. i’d appreciate any advice you all would have here. 

furthermore, coming from a physics background means i missed out typical engineering skill development. for example, i don’t have any cad experience, and i am under the impression this is kind of assumed of applicants to engineering jobs. i’m trying to make up for some of the lacking areas with my classes, so i’ve taken dynamics, biomechanics, computational physiology, modeling and simulation of human movement, control systems (among others as well, but these stick out as potentially important for a career in this area). do you guys believe there are other fundamental areas that i need to take courses in to be truly qualified for engineering positions in industry? 

really i just need some direction, with an idea of where and how to go about even looking for a job. my advisor is really pushing for a career in research and following up the phd with a post doc, so i don’t feel quite comfortable yet sitting down with him to discuss this without being better educated on my options.

0,make me feel better - tell me your overseas manufacturing horror stories,1,311,123,1550632848,"make me feel better - tell me your overseas manufacturing horror stories i work for a us consumer goods company. we make plastic injection molded stuff. due to relentless cost pressures from retailers we manufacture in china. we work with four main factories and they're all so, so horrible. i'm sure there are great factories in china, but we can't afford them. anyone with their shit together is undoubtedly out of our price range. 

&#x200b;

**situation 1:** factory a was out of spec on the snap features for a new product. i told them they needed to modifying the tool to get in spec. this takes a week and they shoot new parts, which we fedex to the other side of the earth, which takes another week. i measure the parts and nothing has changed. i tell them nothing has changed, but they swear up and down that they revised the tool and shot new parts. i tell them to revise the tool again and send new parts. two more weeks go by and same thing. i'm going ballistic and trying to get the people who control the money to put the fear of god into the factory, but instead i just get a lot of ""maybe it's a language barrier issue? have you tried sending pictures?"" yes, we sent pictures. they're called tool release drawings. i also sent them photos, videos, illustrations, and all manner of emails. rinse and repeat one or two more times and we finally get parts that work. 

&#x200b;

four months down the road and their sales rep was feeling chatty (drunk or whatever) and confides on wechat to one of our employees that the actual problem was that factory a just wasn't paying their toolmaker's bills, so the toolmaker wasn't doing any work. instead of getting a business loan or whatever to smooth over their cash crunch, they just lied to us, causing us to waste hundreds of dollars in fedex fees, and more than a month of time, countless hours of my own time, and years from my life. 

&#x200b;

**situation 2:** factory b is awarded the contract to produce a product. all along we've been clear that the strap is supposed to be silicone. we get the first samples and notice that the silicone strap is an amazingly good color match for the tpr overmold on the product. great! then we notice that the strap is getting permanent elephant skin wrinkles, and has a permanent kink. it smells like a garbage fire and feels gross. ""this part was supposed to be silicone. are you sure this is silicone?"" ""yes, this is absolutely silicone."" 

&#x200b;

i take the strap outside and heat it with a lighter. it melts, making flaming drips, and the strap catches fire and sustains it without the lighter. ""we think this is tpr."" ""no, i promise it is silicone, but it is injection silicone. \[i.e. lsr\] maybe you don't like injection silicone? we can make it from pressed silicone instead."" surprisingly they retool the part for pressed silicone without any charge to us. they send us new parts and they're exactly what we wanted. it only delayed our project by a month. 

&#x200b;

a year and  a half later, we're discussing another new project with them. we ask if this product can be made from tpr. the sales rep for factory b says they don't think that would be a good idea because it would wrinkle and form a permanent kink just like when they used tpr for that strap on that other project. he'd totally forgotten to maintain the lie.

i'm an young engineer, and have recently started an entry level position at a consulting firm that works in the landfill gas industry.

during the interview process, i was told that the position was a mix of general engineering office work and field work, and that i would at times be responsible for cqa (construction quality assurance) - completing and submitting reports, working on cqa and safety plans, etc. in my offer letter they specified ""occasional overnight stays and work on weekends"" but ""generally a standard 40+ hour work week"".

i've been working for just under 2 months, and now i'm finding out that my position is expected to also do cqc (construction quality control) in the field, documenting the whole construction process and ensuring everything is done correctly. it isn't exactly what i was told in my interview, but whatever - i'll get the opportunity to see the field a little more than i expected. not an overall bad deal, or so i thought...

right now i'm currently on a landfill working with a crew of 3 members. their supervisor is gone. the next closest person ""in command"" is new to the company and is unfamiliar with the policies. my principal engineer promised me that i would have one of the construction supervisors on site with me to answer questions, and that we'd have an experienced cqc here to work with me and show me the ropes. however, i get to the site, and neither of these people are here.

i cannot answer the questions that the construction crew is asking me, because i was not trained to do this. when i call the engineers in my office to ask questions, they're really dismissive and tell me that this is easy work, i should just ""understand it"". i understand how to fill out my logs, but i was never fully briefed on the safety information, never told what to expect, i was literally given a one way plane ticket to the job site with no expectated completion date. i was told ""we'll just keep extending your hotel reservation until it's finished and buy you a plane ticket back whenever the project is over"". i was also promised a company credit card for expenses on trips during my interview, but they did not get the card to me in time. for now i'm paying for everything out of pocket, expecting to be reimbursed in the next 2 months.

crew members rarely wear their hard hats, and constantly smoke on the landfill. i ask them to stop, and call their supervisor but am essentially told ""not to worry about it unless osha or the client comes up on the landfill"". my employer has asked me in the past to delete pictures/records of employees not wearing their hard hats. there are tasks that require two crew members to work over a 100'+ borehole, but the company only supplied us with one safety harness. i was given a personal gas meters, but the rest of the crew was not, even though the client's policy states all employees working on site must have the meters on their person.

i expected to be thrown to the wolves somewhat, but i honestly feel like i'm being dicked around a little bit here. am i being unreasonable? is this a common experience in the engineering world? i feel extremely unsafe, and would prefer that an actual trained, experienced cqc person was here to work with me. my name is attached to these reports but i don't feel comfortable certifying that this construction project was done safely, or to the standards set out in our cqa plan.

i'd appreciate any advice or recommendations you could give me.

&#x200b;

angles - start with a huge circle and divide as necessary.  when shrunk down to a smaller circle, the error should be smaller.

roundness - a rotating bar will become round if 2 bearings are constrained and the bar is machined with a stationary tool of sufficient rigidity.  then move the bearings to the recently-machined portion.  measuring the perpendicularity of the tool may be an issue.

concentricity - maybe not an issue if the roundness problem is properly taken care of??

flatness - ?? same ""scale-down"" approach as angles, immerse a large plane in a liquid of very low surface tension?  then use that plane to make a smaller tool/instrument?

parallelism / perpendicularity- i'm not sure, but maybe something like a very long plumb-bob and a pool of liquid?  related to flatness.

straightness - ?? most guides on how to make a wooden board straight begin with an already-straight board.  could be done by making a round bar but a very long bar would bend during manufacture or require additional bearings which may not be concentric with each other.  related to flatness.

length - start with a standard unit of length, then ??

a cheap and effective solution i've been told of is treating them with borax but my understanding is this only works on natural fibers.

the fire marshal will be conducting flame tests on the fort. i would love to learn how to do this on my own and find out exactly what to look for.

guidance provided by our air force liaison:

* use imagery that doesn't really on fine detail as they could be embroidered on a patch. ideally the images would be recognizable by profile alone.

* overlay or interlocking symbols are good. 

* avoid airframe specific images. we love the jets that the af has, but their mission can and will change over time as airframes are moved or retired.

* limit to 3 or fewer symbols. they encourage us to use symbols that can support several meaning or interpretations that we apply. 

* restrictions on colors are pretty severe. bold primary colors, gray, black, white, gold, steel, and darker secondary colors are okay. no bright colors.

i work as a design engineer ( for 3 years) with excellent skill using 3d cad software and converting these to 2d drawings like dxf. i also have the responsibility for ordering parts/equipment, keeping track of stock, ensuring everything is where it needs to be when it needs to be there and just being a general dogs body for the guy i work under (he is a nice guy, but passes a lot of his responsibilities on to me, he’s also a director). i’ve also been told i have to constantly remind one of the directors when he should order parts i can’t order as i’m the only person in the office who is even remotely organised (and by constantly i mean i’ll remind him for about 3 weeks strait and it’ll still arrive late because he won’t have done it until the day it was supposed to arrive).

i’m 22 and earning £20,000, university part time will cost ~£3,500 a year for 5 years and i’ll be missing a days work ~25 days of the year, i do about 1 hours unpaid overtime each day anyway and always have done, so i feel like that covers the missed days.

i have no reference for wages, but i feel like this is unfair and i may as well find a better paying job and fund university myself.

i’ve been told by one of the directors that i’m ‘invaluable to the company’ (mainly because i’m organised), but i’m not earning enough to get a mortgage on a house even with my savings (~£10,000), and the prospect of having to live with my parent until i’m at least 28 depresses me.

i just need advise really on what i should do, i feel like i work hard but don’t get anything for it, but don’t know what someone in my position should be earning. but with no degree i feel a bit stuck until i get it and can prove what i’m capable of on paper, even though i can already do it.",104,1869,17,356

* i have a bs electrical and computer engineering, with a 3.75+ gpa. i know gpas don't really matter to a large degree, but i am mentioning because i feel like it is relevant to companies in a new job search situation.

* i have 4+ years experience in an automation engineer role for a very large manufacturing company, where i'm tasked with performing a variety of different functions. these include programming in languages that are new and old (.net, java, fortran, etc), dba work in mssql and oracle rdb, windows server administration, and other miscellaneous network/automation related platforms. nothing plc or direct automation related, however.

* i am wrapping up an ms computer information systems, currently with a 3.95 gpa. i love my degree program, but again, i feel like it is quite wide in scope.


with that background in place.. i have about 2 years before i'd like to begin looking for jobs. i feel like i have a good enough resume to have a great shot at some interesting and challenging jobs. however, i look at jobs around the us pretty regularly and can't help but feel like i still don't directly qualify for many of them. despite my experience in my current position, i don't feel like a legitimate pure software developer, dba, it systems professional. i just feel like i can kinda figure out how to do whatever i need to because i work pretty much on my own without much structure/guidance/project management/expectations.

i do consider myself ambitious and hardworking, despite suffering a little bit from impostor syndrome. i also feel like i can learn to do well in any position that i can get. with a 2 year lead time, i want to improve my skills to the point where i feel confident applying to senior positions in a new city. i feel like virtually all of the positions i am seeing are very specific: full stack senior developer, senior dba, etc.

does anyone have any advice for a situation like this? do i need to just put my head down and lean into whichever aspect of my job i enjoy the best (for example, molding myself into a pure dba for career advancement purposes?)

so i recently graduated in sp 18 with a degree in mechanical engineering from ohio state with a decent gpa (3.25). i had plans to join the air force after school, but as time progressed some of the things i was initially told didn't seem to pan out to what would actually happen if i joined, so i'm looking at other options now and having a minor freak out with loans due soon. one option that was suggested by an older friend is doing some field engineering work with plc's, which i have little experience with other than hearing of them while working for an oem office. the closest work i have to plc's seems to be with micro controllers, of which i have about a year of experience through projects. 

so my question is this: for anyone that has worked with plc's before or is a controls engineer, would spending a couple grand on doing plc training with rslogix500 and rslogix5000 be worth it? from what i've seen, it seems that this could give me a jump start over other candidates recently out of school, and could also give me some leverage to command a higher starting salary. the prospects for plc work appear to have a strong outlook, and it's a field i can see myself working in provided i can get through the first few years of field work and travel.

i shared these concerns with my team's manager (we'll call her alice) and suggested that i get a refund for the course and teach myself instead, since i feel i would learn more that way. she agreed with my assessment and told me that they would give me a few weeks and then send me some exercises to help test what i had learned. i told her that sounded good and that i would get started teaching myself with the materials i had found and left it at that.

the next day, it installed visual studio on my machine and i spent a couple of days working through lessons and teaching myself. but then just yesterday my direct supervisor (we'll call him joe) stopped by my office and asked what i had been working on. i told him, and he said that he didn't think alice ""had intended that to be contract work."" in other words, i'm not supposed to teach myself c++ on company time.

i could understand this if i were so busy with other critical tasks that they needed me to focus on instead. but it's actually quite the opposite. my time at the company has been interminably slow and dull, and most of the things they ask me to do are trivial busywork, seemingly scrounged up so that i actually have something to do. there is a larger, long-term project that i've been working with joe on, but it's been bottlenecked due to his unresponsiveness and inaction so i've been spending a lot of time waiting on him (that's honestly a whole other can of worms i might end up making a post about...).

anyway, it's now clear to me that i'm expected to spend my free time doing a work-related task for no pay. i am salaried, but i am required to log my hours worked and am explicitly paid to work 40 hours per week. the company has an official overtime policy, but i was not offered overtime pay for this work. 

ultimately, it's not the end of the world if i have to teach myself in my free time. but i can't help but feel like i'm being taken advantage of. am i being unreasonable/entitled? is there some aspect to this from management's point of view that i'm missing? just wanted to get some perspective on this situation from some more experienced folks.

 the building owner has asked me to double sheet the floor with 3/4 in plywood over the existing carpet then some type of flooring to withstand the weight (125/foot when seated?) i thought that two sheets was excessive and feel the floor transition would be difficult.

 my first instinct was to cut back the floor and double the 4 center joists (under the chair area).  second was cut out the damage ply and replace it while cross bracing the joists.  at a minimum i want to pull the carpet back to look, this being a 100 year old building i understand they do not want me opening much.

he says that he's built cell tower sites for 10 years in his career and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. there was a reason he stated that he'd continue to do cell tower work in his future, and his reason is that if satellites existed, he'd be out of a job. 

his only attempt for a supportive statement here is that there's no receiving equipment at the cell sites to receive satellite signals. then he also calls nasa and the us government on their bluff of siphoning billions of dollars to do fake research and make fake observations about the planet earth. he finished off to say people have never left the atmosphere and that us tax dollars funding nasa would be better served to provide a universal health service.",177,1053,31,187

_______

######the ~~battle~~playingfield: 
a big city courtyard. some plants are in a sad patch of dirt we call garden, it's for everyone. in the middle, there's more than enough empty space for a tomato. 

######the backstory: 
i have a few tomatoes, in pots. someone suggested i plant one in the garden, i did. with a strong bamboo stick which i hammered .5m into the ground, and tied the tomato to it nicely. it was a good tomato and i grew it from a single seed. one neighbor ripped it out at night, and the stick too. the guy is ~80 and thinks he owns the yard, he also reads peoples letters in the trash. think napoleon-complex meets retirements meets binoculars. he put the stick in the ground and tied his beans to it. i think those of you who are still reading get why this isn't something i will bother my landlord with but instead want a solution that will make him suffer.

i planted the next tomato, he ripped it out again. repeat until 1 tomato left. please reddit, the last tomato is named *trotzki*, please help me save him. he needs to be planted because the pot is too small, but the yard out there is certain death:

whatever i plant next, he will watch me plant it from his flat and the same night, try to rip out again. he's been watching how the tomatoes on my window have been decimated, one after the other gets planted, there's only trotzki left on my window, then that's it. this is what he lives for, watching people, criticizing people, destroying peoples tomatoes. i want him to try **and fail**. i want him to work hours and hours trying to remove the next tomato and give up in defeat. i want to break his spirit like he broke my tomatoes little stems. 



######what i need help for: 

the most direct idea so far is to hammer a stick in the ground so securely he can't get it out ever again. something with barbed hooks that can only go deeper into the ground. or cement it in, or similar. if someone has a simple, quick and indestructible solution for that, i think it might work. i'll plant a decoy-tomato next to it, he'll rip out the tomato, then try the stick, and fail. then, when he's gone through the sages of grief, i plant the real tomato and tie it to the stick. 

######other ideas: 

any other ideas that will defeat the neighbor are okay. if one of you has access to a hitman, affordable security personell, heck even a precise drone strike,  i'm fine with that. i'm budget constrained though, and all of this needs to be a) under the landlords radar, and b) free of civilian casualties.

######facts: 

- i'm willing to put in one whole nights work and $50 in material.

- i have a hardware store 30min from me, no car though. 

- the dirt in the yard (surface) is soft, low nutritioun, garbage. the tomato needs to root downwards to get to proper dirt. 

- trotzki is a healthy tomato, and about to sprout more stems once planted

- my neighbor is a class 1 asshole and there's no discussion to be had about morality here, this is full blown war against a terrorist who commits atrocities. still protected by the geneva convention though. 

- the tomato needs to be planted asap, the pot it's in is too small and it needs more dirt.

0,"Making a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine and generator, searching for some additional information on design and wiring.",1,30,21,1535962329,"making a vertical axis wind turbine and generator, searching for some additional information on design and wiring. this is a complicated question to ask but it seems this is as good a place as any to post it, though if there is a better source of information please point me to it. to start i will specify the factors i've been working with so far:

i've chosen a vertical axis design because from what i've gathered it's a better fit for smaller scale applications and high turbulance areas, it's location is a cabin in a clearing of woods. the average wind speed for the area my turbine will be designed for is 4-5 m/s. the design of the turbine is not finished yet, but i desire high starting torque as i'm under the impression that will give me more consistent performance in low speed wind. to achieve this high torque in the simplest and cheapest way i've come up with, the turbine will be double rotor savonius with one fin to slightly increase it's inherent low efficiency. i lack in understanding of turbine design, i don't know what measurements i need to take to determine tip speed ratios or even rpm. any advice in this area is greatly appreciated.

the other component to this project of mine is the generator. this has been my main focus in my research and i'm confident in my ability to fabricate the neccesary parts but i still need to iron out several details, especially for safety precautions. the design is based around ""axial flux alternators"" as i've seen them called, though i'm not certain if that is the correct term. my stator will consist of 9 coils in 3 phases wired in series. the coils will be wound with 20 gauge enameled wire reclaimed from motors. the permanent magnet rotor will have 12 1""×1/2""×1/8"" rectangular neodymium magnets with an individual gauss rating of 13800. i desire a 14v output at average wind speeds for charging a 12v battery, from what i've gathered i need to use faraday's law to determine how many turns are neccesary in my coils for 14v output at a given rpm. i plugged in 300 rpm and my wire diameter, magnet area and tesla rating and got ~116 turns per coil, does that seem fairly accurate or is there something i missed? i can link to the website i found the info on faraday's law if anyone is interested. 

finally i want to address how to handle the voltage generated safely and simply. i know my alternator will produce 3 phase ac that needs to be rectified into dc before connecting to a charge controller. i also know that i need some form of dump load for high wattage from excessive rpm in the case of extreme wind. 

as far as progress so far, ive ordered the magnets and epoxy resin for fabricating the generator and they should arrive this week. i plan to start winding the coils in the next couple days and hope to have a working prototype for testing in a week or two. i haven't started any work on the turbine itself but i know i want it to be roughly 4'x4' and 25' in height. also i need to get my wiring completely figured out so i know what components to order, so far i know i need a full bridge rectifyer, ~500w resistor for a dump load, and some kind of charge controller. also i'm not sure where the dump load gets wired into the circuit.

to conclude i want to state that this is just a fun passion project based on a newfound interest in electricity and surplus of free copper in my life. i will post updates as i complete different stages of the design if anyone would like to see how it turns out. any tips or information regarding the different formulas and variables i've failed to address will make me happy. thanks for taking the time to read.",114,3516,17,648

0,Career Advice: What to do if you feel if you're stagnating,1,18,19,1535506567,"career advice: what to do if you feel if you're stagnating  i'm an electrical engineer with a bachelor's and master's degree, and i'm still working the same job that i got immediately out of college. it's been a little over two years now, not yet three, so i just wanted to ask about when you decided to switch jobs to further your career. i'm just unsure as to whether i should look for another job, so i just thought to get some professional opinions here.

​

i guess i'm not really sure why i chose electrical engineering. i'd say i probably had a desire to build stuff, so i chose electrical engineering, though i guess i spent my senior year doing more programming rather than actual hardware work like with op-amps and feedback circuits. after i graduated in 2014 with a bachelor's, i really wasn't sure what to do, so i figured i'd go for my master's degree at the same university, finishing it in 2016. then, when i went job searching, i found that my university had an opening, so i applied and got the job there, which is where i am today.

​

the job is nice, and there are a lot of great benefits. also, considering that i still live with my parents, i don't have much to worry about in terms of a mortgage or rent. i guess the downside is that i can't help but think i'm stagnating with regards to my career. people always talk about either changing the world or making lots of money with an engineering skill set. for me, i probably thought that way at some point, but i'm not so sure if i feel that way anymore. my current employer was the first one that actually replied back to my resume, so i just took what i could because i couldn't stay unemployed. it would be nice to switch jobs and probably build my career learning new things and such, but right now, i can't help but think that in the end, it doesn't even matter and that nothing i do will have real significance, and i'm a little afraid of forgoing the life i have now. honestly, the only real reason i'd consider looking for another job is mainly for financial reasons, but getting a job out of state would incur more significant costs compared to my current situation today even if the pay is a lot more. is this line of thought normal for people just starting out like me in the world of engineering, or maybe i just feel this way cause i don't really do much to make life meaningful?",58,2306,11,430

at first everything seemed like to was going to be great. the company make some really cool stuff for alot of different high end cars. i'd be working/training under the only other engineer there so i'd get alot of one on one. i couldn't wait to dive right and and get to learning about gearbox design. 

i was told i'd start out in inspection just to get a feel for what we made and how tight the tolerances were. i figured this would help me in my design work and i'm all for a little bit of hands on work anyway. next i was told i was going to learn how some of our assemblies go, so that i could improve the build instructions. again, makes sense.

here we are a year later and i'm still just inspecting parts and have become the sole assembler of the product i was trained on. ive probably sat at my desk 10 times in the past year. ive had conversations with my boss several times now about how i feel i got screwed and he keep promising i'll get to do what i was actually hired to do soon. 

i've thought about quittig and finding something but:
1) i feel like i'll be starting from square one yet again because i haven't gotten any design experience in this job. this will make it hard yet again to find what i want. i have no desire to be a quality engineer. 
2) the company itself is severely understaffed as it is and doesn't seem to be doing well financially. i feel like if i leave it will totally screw them and i'd feel bad.

let's say the earth's surface is a radiated hellscape. you've been tasked with creating an underground 'ark' that can sustain a human population for hundreds of years.

let's also say **money**, **manpower**, **time** or **political capital** is no object. what could we do with current, or near-future technology, if we were building an installation to house, say, 500 people with a birth/death ratio of 1:1. 

\-- **air.** would such a complex be able to have its own internal oxygen-generation system? electrolysis from water? a biosphere? even with an excellent air filtration system in place from the topside, you would probably want a backup in case it ever breaks down, no? 

\-- **food** would probably have to be grown for that amount of time, so would it make sense for such an installation to have not just greenhouses for veggies, but also livestock somehow? could we have farms under ground? or would fish make more sense, maybe an aquaponic solution?

\-- **power.** what would be the most efficient source here for this amount of time? solar cells from the surface? or a small nuclear reactor under ground? what about fuel cells?  geo-thermal power? and how much power would we need?

\-- **water.** as i understand it, we are able to purify irradiated water so are there any significant challenges here? how would we access the natural water deposits? are some sources better than others?

\-- **sewage**. any special considerations here? and would bacteria/infection be a unique challenge in such a closed system?

\-- **seed archive.** it might make sense to have a large collection of seeds for commonly planted crops for when the survivors re-emerge. from reading about the seedbank on svalbard, they would need to be stored in freezing temperatures and a low-oxygen environment to delay decay, i think?

&#x200b;

**maintenance**: what kind of actions would be needed on a day-to-day basis to maintain such a large system, and keep it from failing?

&#x200b;

***p.s. i know the extinction event here is highly implausible, and i know that it wouldn't take radiation levels two-three centuries to drop to non-lethal. but for the purposes of this hypothetical, let's just suspend our collective disbelief! :)***

0,Helping an engineering colleague improve communication skills,1,43,29,1535029740,"helping an engineering colleague improve communication skills good morning r/askengineers,

i am trying to help a colleague, former engineer and now technical sales rep, become a better communicator with those on the business side of things. i'm in business development.

&#x200b;

my colleague's communications are very technical and thorough, but do not convey their true needs. as such, there is almost always quite a bit of lost in translation happening. one example was a very thought out and verbose email that was taken by the team as a request to create a new accessory for an existing product. after quite a bit of back and fourth, a quick phone conversation uncovered that the desired outcome of the email wasn't to purchase or create a new accessory, but to see if an existing accessory in the market would meet code for a customer with a unique issue.

&#x200b;

when talk with my colleague, we can usually get to the root issue or question they are attempting to raise, but email communications are a bit of an achilles heel. i know that communication is very much a two way street, but i'm to try and help my colleague work with multiple teams as best i can.

&#x200b;

are there any books or resources you could share that have helped you to better communicate with sales and marketing teams?

i have, like a lot of team leaders/managers, a technical background. i was promoted because i was the focal point of the team, the guy who allowed others to produce, the guy who always had a solution to every problem, etc.

all was nice and cool, until i realized i didn’t know squat about managing people. i took a step back and re-evaluated everything.

i think i’m making progress, however, there’s one area i’m still not comfortable with: micromanaging. i’m not against giving people autonomy to do their job, what i don’t like is to give others autonomy until i know they are ready.

- in some cases, team members just don’t care about “improving” their skills, so they remain at a low skill level and yet don’t want to be told how to do their job. if i have to guarantee productivity and high quality on the job, this makes it very hard.

- another issue is organization. in some instances, i know timelines are tight, so i set down tasks, schedule activites and assign them to my team. and they not always take it well. too much of this makes them feel “they have to do what i want all the time”. but how can i organize work if i don’t do this?

- code quality: sometimes i code review their code, and whenever i ask them to correct something giving them a logical explanation, their reaction is not always good. interns don’t complain, but seniors get angry that “they have to write code the way i want”.

i corrected a coworker’s code once because he had mixed try/catch blocks and if/else blocks to handle errors: it was unmaintainable and not all error cases were covered because of the mess. i pointed out it could be written better, and asked him to review it and use only one way to handle errors. he did it, but his reaction to another team member was very telling: “i’m tired of all these lessons...if it works, keep your mouth shut and let it be...”

but there's another handicap: the character has little to know experice with this field, apart from maybe a 3rd grade science kit. so all the skills/instructions needed would have to be obtainable over the internet (be it the dark and scary corners) and all materials must be easy to acquire.

0,My team is subject to a lot of negative external influence from external coworkers in spite of our high performance. How can I protect myself from potential complaints?,1,64,25,1534444658,"my team is subject to a lot of negative external influence from external coworkers in spite of our high performance. how can i protect myself from potential complaints? ok, here we go: i’m a guy who acts as a team leader (always, official title!) and **project manager** (some projects), my team was formed by two women and me last year, and both became, eventually, friends.

becoming friends made it difficult when i had to reprimend one or tell them to do their tasks and stop “helping each other” if the “helping” was just enabling bad behavior. eg, woman a wouldn’t study something because the other one was better at it, even though woman a needed to know it anyway.

eventually one of them got transferred after she tried to undermine me and get me to lose my position. the other one remained, and i got a new guy as a replacement.

i recently found out, however, that the woman who works with me regularily chats with the other one about me and my “negative sides”.

the one who got transferred, in turn, spills all of this to other people in the company, and it already got to my manager.

for example, during one of this chit chat events, my manager’s secretary (another close friend of the ex-team member, and an ex pm who couldn’t do her job and got demoted) is now suggesting that they tell my coworker to talk to my manager about me because “i’m not in charge and i need to stop treating my team members like interns”

all of this is worrying me because the whole thing is aimed at undermining me, and it’s done by people who aren’t even working with me.

how on earth can i protect myself against this and go to work with complete ease? i can take my team members complaining about me because, well, i’m the boss so that’s to be expected, but i cannot tolerate that every single complian is a tragedy blown out of proportion because it’ll end up costing me my position.

and the woman who’s enabling this is using it to cover her own ass. if i end up as the dictator asshole who wants to boss other people around, her own deficiencies, that actually require being bossed around, can be forgiven...

so, she strikes from afar, saying “see? not even her current saint of a coworker can tolerate him...”, spin, casually, in the direction of my manager...

and i swear to god, if i lose my position because of this, i’m gonna raise so much hell with the owners that these two will either get fired or seriously reprimended... but i don’t want that.

what can i do guys? any advice?

i've been struggling with anxiety and depression for the last few months. i find engineering to be interesting, and was able to keep up with a very, very strenuous workload last semester. by now 99% of the magic has faded and i don't have the same interest i did last semester.

i just started school this past week, and already feel stressed and depressed in spite of my best efforts to curb anxiety. my best efforts never even cured it, really, so going back to school just adds more to the plate that i can't work through i guess. i thought that part-time classes would not be too strenuous, however, mentally, it is just a burden. i get bad racing thoughts related to engineering and just don't want to do much else. other activities don't seem to lessen this. not doing anything leads to depression but when i'm not worried about engineering i at least find it easier to do other things. i've always had healthy habits related to working out, eating, etc. i just need some sort of direction in life, so i can't rule out school forever... have to be an adult at some point.

i am considering trying to persevere through this in hope that the anxiety/depression will lessen and in pursuit of good pay and ""comfortable living."" another option i am strongly considering now is switching majors because i can actually see myself working in a biology field as a field biologist. of course, that comes with less pay, and maybe more stress from job hunting? i don't really know. i can't predict the future, but i can say that i am more than unhappy sticking with engineering, i am depressed and anxious and unable to manage it. i am just beginning to work with my counselor and therapist soon on the 20th but i don't think i can stick school out while trying to figure out how to not be anxious",106,1799,18,324

when using the new fan (ø40cm, 140w, 6000m³/h), before putting in the box and adding filters, it moved a lot of air even on the lowest speed , but afterwards no air is moving forward.

i watched this video (linked to relevent part) to see where to put the front:  
https://youtu.be/fakm4w_9ac8?t=374

looking around, i saw fans online that had a cone or duct around them and i thought that would help so i made one:  
https://i.imgur.com/qq5hjpr.jpg

that does help slightly, but the air is still not moving forward (a lot); in fact it goes to the sides of the box and moves the curtains you see the behind it.  
i thought about extending the duct, but before that i did the test you see in the video (and came here to ask) and the air isn't drawn into the sides, but i discovered that it's drawn into the center of the fan.

even though i have the filters in the back, i would like to be able to use it normally, with air moving forward, and i was expecting it to work that way since the smaller one did (though the smaller one has a round dome in the center of the blades).  
what should i do?  
put a cover in the center? if so, does it need to be a certain shape and/or thickness?  
should i extend the center? put an angled extension?

i know that these places hire all types of engineers, as building a rocket, probe, or shuttle takes expertise from all disciplines of engineering. from what i understand, aerospace engineers would handle propulsion, aerodynamics, and thermodynamics (like heat dissipation).

so now the actual questions, so this isn't me just venting.

1) is it safe to assume that a degree in aerospace engineering wont be a waste of four years and scholarships? basically can i rely on jobs being open?

2) if not aerospace engineering, what degree would increase my chances of working on craft that exit earths atmosphere. i.e. rockets, probes, landers, anything having to do with space.

3) is it worth the trouble of double majoring in engineering programs (aero and electrical or mechanical)? is it worth sacrificing the time i spend networking, and trying to get my name in the heads of hiring managers?

4)  my school (like many) allows me to peruse a minor in physics, so would it be beneficial to do declare a minor in that?

the wheel is going to be ~600mm in diameter and he's approximated it at about 2kg maximum once it's fully loaded.

he's also looking at it rotating at around 10rpm, although probably anywhere between 5 and 10rpm would be fine, but it will need to rotate continuously for about 8 hours a day for 4 days. this would be on a 12v car battery, but i think it would be permissible to use more than one if needs be.

what would be the cheapest solution to this that would be practical without laser-cutters, cnc machines, etc. to build gearing? he'd prefer not to spend much more than £20 as it would literally only be used on those few days. i don't know if that's possible, but surprise me!

i work with a water utility that uses electronic endpoints on its meters which are then picked up by a receiver. a typical coverage radius on these receivers is about one mile and picks up  between 2000 - 5000 endpoints. it looks like a new signal somewhere is blasting on the same frequencies as our endpoints and i'm asking here to figure out if there are any tools available (fcc, triangulation etc.) to find this source to determine its legality.

the other day, i was looking at graphs of receiver performance and noticed that a group of receivers has plummeted from about 3000 endpoints read per day to about 300. this drop occurred across multiple receivers in the same geographical area (five receivers within a two-mile radius) and all occurred at the same time. this tells me its not a hardware issue and that it's interference from another signal.

these are spread spectrum devices in the 910-920mhz range and operate in a 0.1w and 1.0w mode and both signals are getting lost in the noise. are there legitimate sources that could be drowning out the signals? could this be an unlicensed transmission? are there any ways to see if new transmitters have been deployed in the area in order to track down the source (e.g. fcc database)?

i'm trying to create a product that includes a timer and an electromagnet. basically, all i want is a pcb so that i can press a button, and the electromagnet turns on for an hour before turning itself off. after it is off, it does not turn on until the next button press, in which it should run for the same hour duration again (and so on). the electromagnet is being run off of 2 aa batteries.

not sure if this is relevant, but the current being sent to the electromagnet is ~30 milliamps.

it is important that there is no way the electromagnet will stay on longer than the one hour period. eg if there is a soldering crack or something of that sort, the electromagnet needs to not have power (rather than stay magnetized until the batteries finally drain).

the ee first pointed us to ti5110 nanotimer (http://www.ti.com/product/tpl5110/), along with a p-channel transistor. however, the pcb he sent us at first was completely wrong and didn't put the timer into 'one-shot' mode. next, he sent us a pcb that has a whole number of other issues which kept the electromagnet magnetized beyond the required duration.

when we looked at it ourselves, we thought we should be using a ti5111 timer (http://www.ti.com/product/tpl5111/) rather than a 5110, as the default to pin 5 is low rather than high - so i would think that eliminates malfunctions in the timer or soldering to have the electromagnet magnetized.

the button we are using is https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/te-connectivity-alcoswitch-switches/fsm6jsma/450-1133-nd/525822 - can switch to another small button if needed though.

basically my ask is if someone can just tell us if the 5111 timer sounds like it suits our needs, or if he pointed us in the complete wrong direction.

we need very low power consumption so that the product has a long shelf life - eg. the timers we are looking at are 35na. the batteries will never be replaced. i would think there is an ultra cheap solution for what we are trying to do, since it's just a very straightforward concept.

the column is about 3 feet tall and sits vertically on top of the foot. there are two 7.6mm through holes in the foot which line up with 7.6mm blind holes in the column. once we have the foot and the column aligned, we are then supposed to ream out the holes with an 8mm reamer and knock a pin in to secure the fit.

we are currently doing this by laying the machine on its back, aligning foot and column, and then reaming with a corded drill. we have also tried leaving the machine in the upright position and reaming from underneath, but then you get debris all over you.

in both cases the pin is always loose. in the few units we have tested, we have had to use loctite to secure the pin.

i would suspect most of our problem stems from vibrations and misalignment due to reaming by hand, but given our setup there is no other option. what else can i do to get better results? should we just try a smaller diameter reamer?",28,1247,6,237

i just finished my it minor and am going to a computer science major. for my it undergrad i studied about 5-6 hours each day, albeit most of the time i studied it-related topics, not necessarily the thing required for a course. if i average my time, i studied 2-3 hours each day exclusively for my it minor.

when my friend who went to a computer science minor came to my apartment to hang out, he told me that he learned probability in 4 days (10 hours each day) before an exam. to my amazement, he produced correct answers to some tasks which i struggled with (at the time, i was learning it and he decided to step in and help me). the probability exercises weren't so hard, but still it was an impressive feat, because probability ain't easy. i also have a friend who worked 5-6 hours a day each workday and still managed to pass his computer science major with really good grades.

my question is - *how do you study so efficiently?*

i am currently adopting to working at least 7 hours a day each workday, but i am really curious about your efficiency while studying. *how can you (engineers) be so efficient while studying?* i am more of a person who chips away at things day in day out, but if i'm investing at least 7 hours each day then after 6 months or a year i should be light years ahead of someone who studies 2-3 days before an exam.

please help me understand this phenomenon.

p.s. there are a lot of programs about ""efficient learning"" out there. most of them seem full of fluff. i read *how to be a straight-a student* by cal newport and *make it stick* and from those books i implemented organizing my days, reviewing periodically (hence the use of anki) and testing myself (that is also done by answering the questions in anki). if you have anything you have used and it helped you, let me know.",68,1829,12,334

# what's an average day like for an engineer?

one of the most common questions asked by people looking into a career in engineering is, *""what do engineers actually do?*"" or, *""what's an average day like for an engineer?""* while these questions may appear simple, they're a gateway to a vast amount of information... much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful, and often fails to describe anything specific about engineering work.

to offer more practical information, askengineers hosts this annual work experience thread where engineers can talk about their daily job activities and career in general. this series has been successful in guiding students towards the best major for them, and helping engineers better understand what their counterparts in other disciplines do.

today's thread is for engineers who want to share their stories, advice, and collective knowledge with our community. the responses here will be archived in the askengineers wiki and made available as a public resource.

doesn't really matter by what means. could just mix hydrogen and air at the intake and use lots of back flash arrestors. 

could hook up the high pressure liquid hydrogen gas to the fuel line, and hope the fuel injectors work.. they already spray at 3k psi so maybe they have the hardware to not just blow up from the pressure of liquid hydrogen. 

so let's say theoretically we get this working, what would happen to the gasoline engine?

nothing?

would the pistons melt?

0,A coefficient of friction mystery. Help!,1,18,28,1531176186,"a coefficient of friction mystery. help! hi all,

first time redditor here!

i am currently working on a project housing crickets and cockroaches as food for my reptiles. for anyone who is not familiar with this practice, most people keep their insects in storage tubs filled with egg crates to better utilise the space within them (also used to provide warmth, security, etc). my issue is keeping them contained - particularly species of cockroaches, who are notoriously good escape artists and can climb even the smoothest of surfaces. the go-to solution for people in the hobby is fluon - a teflon-based solution which is painted on a surface, drying to a chalky texture that, if applied properly, will successfully contain most species of insects. however, fluon is only a temporary solution and must be removed and reapplied every so often. it also rubs off very easily. i am looking for a permanent solution, that neither deteriorates nor damages easily. i have done a considerable amount of research surrounding the co-efficient of friction of different materials, and have concluded that a teflon-based product is what i require, however, i have tried teflon tapes in various forms (tapes claiming to be teflon with an adhesive applied to one side; as well as teflon-coated, glass fibre tapes) to no avail. whilst i have worked out that fibrous textures are a no-go, i am unsure as to why a barrier made of a tape claiming to be teflon can be breached whilst a fluon one cannot.

after speaking with somebody on another engineering subreddit, it has become evident that coefficient of friction may not be the (only) issue, and that i may need to find a harder material which insects cannot hook into to climb their way up. i am aware that imperfections in the surface of the material and/or dirt on the surface provide insects with a potential way of climbing up, but the softness of the material hadn't occurred to be prior to receiving a response. the issue i have with this is lining the inside of the tub with said material, as it obviously needs to be hard enough to avoid insects hooking in, but soft enough to work around the curves of the tub walls.

i am also aware that glass is an obvious answer to the hardness of a material, however, i will be moving the container around, and glass is heavy and impractical. i will settle for this if i cannot find another solution.

i am currently waiting for a teflon sheet for heat transfer/t-shirt printing to arrive in the mail (https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3a%2f%2fwww.ebay.com.au%2fulk%2fitm%2f282661773924), but below is a list of methods for containing them that are common practice within the hobby but do not work for more advanced climbers/i have thought of on my own and trialled unsuccessfully/i have heard of people using but refuse to use due to mess/practicality, semi-permanence, etc:

my current knowledge about this stuff (actuators, motors, circuitry diagrams, flux capacitors) rounds to zero.  most of the similar projects i found via search felt half-baked -- except [this one](http://www.instructables.com/id/rfid-cat-door/) -- and none of them use a motorized door.

i know there's a fair bit i need to learn, and i'm willing to put in the necessary time & effort.  problem is i'm not sure specifically *what* i need to learn or where to start.  hopefully someone can point me in the right direction.

**more info**

always helps to clearly define the problem, so here are pics of the existing door and a gif of the flap mechanism.  interior dimensions of the opening: 185mm x 185mm (7.25"" x 7.25"").

[outside view.](https://i.imgur.com/2b0j5ih.jpg) hinge is on the left; door flap moves horizontally.

[inside view showing the door's movement on its hinge.](https://i.imgur.com/scf4yxz.gifv) the door also has the same range of motion in the opposite direction, opening inward, though i'd prefer it open outward as shown here.

i am doing research on biomedical device development, and focusing on devices that work on grasping tissues in the abdominal area. i need some help with applying the concepts of material strength to human tissues.

in simple language, let's assume that the stiffness constant (or the spring constant, k) of a given tissue is known, and we assume that it is a constant and hence the compression of the tissue is linearly proportional to the compressive force applied on it.

given that we know k, is there a way to figure out the upper limit of the force or the upper limit of the compression i can allow, before the tissue gets damaged? i.e. can we estimate the compressive yield strength of the tissue given that we know its k?

another small confusion: if we are talking about the point at which tissue damages, is that the point of yield strength or ultimate strength?

i'm familiar with basic solid mechanics and strength of materials on a very beginner level and i'm getting stuck in applying those concepts in the context of biomechanics. any help in this direction would be really helpful.

ps: this is not homework help, i work as an ra and i'm stuck at this issue in my research :)

i graduated about a year ago with a bioengineering degree and i was working as a scientist at a big pharmaceutical company. i've dabbled in programming a bit since college (mainly python) and since then i've always dreamed of getting a software job. i helped develop a data pipeline at the pharma corp which enabled me to to land a software engineering job at a biotech start up in silicon valley area. during the interview, i told them i didn't have most of the skills they required, but that i was highly ambitious and a quick learner. somehow i got the job, but now i think i might get fired.

it's a really small startup, i'm technically #3 on the software team and i quickly learned that we have a lot of responsibilities including database admin, statistical analysis, pipeline development, network admin, network security, and front/backend app development. day one, my boss presents me with a document of stuff to go over, most of which i had never used or heard of. 

it included:

* postgres
* vue.js, react.js, node.js
* scala + (play framework)
* r  + (r shiny framework)
* python + (django, flask, sqlalchemy, biopython)
* aws, docker
* netxflow, groovy
* develop a webscraping pipeline tool
* adding this tool to a docker container into an ec2 instance

my boss has been telling me to socialize more and get to know the research and the scientists. i've tried my best, but honestly i've been pretty much just glued to my computer trying to figure out how to write software. i spent most of the first week reviewing every language/framework there, and developed the webscraping tool in python. by the middle of the second week i was able to set up an ec2 sever with a docker container and get something going. this week i set up an orm and a skeletal front/back end test application for the postgres database. trying to learn all of these languages, tools, and network infrastructure/architecture has been absolutely daunting. i don't feel like i've had a chance to even begin looking at the actual research, let alone socialize.

to add insult to injury, my boss (director of informatics) is probably one of the smartest people i have ever met. i tried asking him for help a few times and the feedback i usually get is so beyond my understanding i just nod my head. i've asked him what is expected of me, and his response usually leaves me more confused than before. he is really busy, but everyday my goals change. initially we were going to use docker containers, but now we are using virtualbox. i was supposed to build a database, but now we are going to use a third-party service. the webscraping tool i built? he built a far more sophisticated one months ago. all of this has left me wondering why my efforts were being directed towards fruitless tasks. 

i really should take him up on the suggestion to socialize more with the scientists, but i've been reluctant because i don't think i can help them. i don't have the programming expertise to just start churning out apps on whim. i spent most of yesterday setting up login authentication with the skeletal web app i made, but he basically made it seem like i was an idiot for doing this because it didn't use ldap.  the worst part is i just started using react and node and learning about authentication methods yesterday, so i really had no idea what i was doing. i was just trying to show him what i had been working on. the consensus was that everything i have been working on has been a complete waste of time. 

i almost feel like my peers are looking down on me and don't want to work with me. they are mainly phds and/or 10-20 years of experience in industry. i can't contribute much in their world, and i know this. today i could tell my boss was really disappointed with how little i know and how little i've accomplished. the whole thing is soul crushing, but what did they expect?  i barely have a year of industry experience, and i don't even come from a software background. they knew this, and the pay, which is definitely lower than most software engineers in this area, also reflects that. 

i'm trying really hard, but i think they are looking at ways to get rid of me. maybe i'm just not cut out for this? i've been so stressed that i've barely slept in almost 3 weeks. i don't know what to do, i know this area is hyper competitive, but after today's meeting i'm feeling absolutely defeated. any advice would be appreciated.

**short verison:**

* new software engineer job
* <1 year of industry experience
* immense responsibilities, little support or guidance
* unsure of my expectations
* feeling like i'm underperforming
* i'm burning out and i think i'm gonna get fired",89,4689,18,820

as a programmer dad, i offered to show them some ropes before they head to school, mostly to alleviate their anxiety, and they are very interested (in other words, i can't back out now!). i have an arduino with bunches of peripherals/sensors which i used with my younger kid for a school project. i figure covering basics of variable typing, declaring a function, and using a library to interact with a sensor or two will give them enough basics to put them more at ease.

**my question for engineers is whether there's anything engineering-specific you'd recommend, whether language features or industry style.**

for instance, whenever i mentor cs interns or junior developers, i focus heavily on *style*, particularly writing self-documenting code, with descriptive variable and function names, and favoring short functions to keep the code readable. however, that may not be appropriate if it's taught differently in college.

the company i'm at has locations in el segundo. i'd really enjoy working there. so my questions are:

1) would it be appropriate to ask my boss at the end of the summer about the feasibility of moving to a different location? they are an entirely different division in the company (same engineering tasks, different product/customer). if it matters, my boss has stressed the flexibility of work locations/tasks at this specific company and i really get the impression that he wants me to learn.

it’s on a seemingly solid piece of concrete, so i can’t see how it could have been a boiler but could it have been connected to a steam or diesel engine for another reason, or been adapted in some way? does the concrete base help date it?

one of the machines for which i am responsible functions via bearings on the bottom of its pedestals rolling over a cam which pushes the pedestals down to accept components. once the pedestal leaves the cam, a spring inside the pedestal assembly pushes it back to proper position.

these components fail regularly and are replaced approximately every six weeks. after the springs and bearings are replaced, machine performance steadily declines day after day until another rebuild is authorized.

to the best of my knowledge, the failing components are the result of oxidization.

the technicians here have tried several solutions. i do not know specifically what they tried, but i know they were not successful.

i asked about springs made out of non-oxidizing materials such as stainless steel (i was told ""no one makes those"") or aluminum (i got a blank stare like i had made the most ridiculous suggestion ever).

which leads me back to my question. would sets of calibrated magnets be plausable replacements for either the springs, bearings,  or both that could hold up for more than a few weeks at a time?

i am originally from california, and i graduated from a with a 3.8 gpa from a uc in 2017 majoring in mechanical engineering. i was fortunate to have an internship and a lab position while at school, so i did have some experience to help fill out my resume. i also took quite a few project classes while at school so those are on there as well. [resume](https://imgur.com/vzpnrjh)
even though i have some experiences working, i feel like i know absolutely nothing. and i am 100% sure it shows in the interviews i have had when applying to jobs. after graduating in late june, and moving to the bay area in july, i was unemployed/had no offer until late february. 
the job i have now i only have because my dad is good friends with someone very high up in at an electronics manufacturing company. he sent his friend his resume and i was basically forced upon this group who does pcs. originally, i was told i would do 1 month training in taiwan, where i would then see where i would go next. i told them i would want to live in the us, in california if possible. they were very vague about my future. 
fast forward to now, early june. i am still doing “training” in taiwan. if i had to pick a job description for myself, it would be somewhere between a “glorified english translator” and a “mechanical engineer project manager.”  my daily duties include helping coworkers with their english homework, writing different mechanical proposals for different projects in power point, and helping the me team communicate with the id team in socal. once a week, for one of the projects we are working on, i help the me team present the proposal to the american (english-speaking) company. 
last week, my boss called me up to basically discuss my future at this company. he “suggested” that i consider working as a foreign person in taiwan, applying for a business visa and what not. the problem is, i am 100% unhappy here.
the work culture here is crazy. the day starts at 8 am, and technically ends at 5:30. many of the workers here stay until 6:15 or later. for me, it takes about 40 minutes one way to commute. so, i leave the house at 7:10 and by the time i come home it’s about 7 again. 
my boss is another american-born chinese, so his english is fantastic. i am pretty sure that’s why he is my boss, seeing how his role is as a business pm and knows nothing about mechanical engineering. he somedays is perfectly fine with me and we have civil talks on the phone or through email. on other days, he’s cussing and yelling frustrations to me (sometimes at me) and i don’t know what to think. i cry pretty regularly, either at night, or afterwards and go to the bathroom. i never know what to expect and am always on edge.
for a long time i have been having suicidal ideations. since moving to taiwan and starting working here, they have only gotten more frequent. i told my dad that everyday at work, i think about “quitting,” and while he was saddened by this, he said i could not quit my job unless i first find a new one.
so, now knowing my predicament, could anyone offer me any advice?  i have also reached out to a past professor who has helped me in the past for advice but he is very busy and has not yet had time to talk to me in depth. my current plan is to apply for jobs in taiwan (to the us), but this is very hard since by the time i wake up, people in the u.s. are getting off work. furthermore, since i had so much trouble getting a job in the first place, with barely any more experience, how am i supposed to find another job?

the pay would be slightly better at the new job, but i feel like i would be losing all of the connections/mentors i have gained at the huge corporation.  these are people who have climbed the corporate ladder with the same company for years, and i am not sure they would want to keep in touch if i left the company due to my disloyalty. also, i am interested in eventually attending grad school and the new company does not explicitly offer tuition reimbursement, so graduate school opportunities may not be on the table.

if i go to a small company, will i ever be able to return to work for a large company again?

is it worth it to find personal satisfaction doing a job you love (small company) vs working a job you hate, but may offer better future opportunities (corporation)?

what are additional things to consider when making this decision and how should i approach it?

thank you in advance.",55,1751,10,310

I need advice on classes to take, and what jobs I could look for.",1,44,27,1528198770,"i (msc. mech. eng) was not happy so i started studying cs/electronics which i love. i need advice on classes to take, and what jobs i could look for. like the title said, after three years working i was not happy as a structural engineer. the most satisfying part of the job was scripting so i figured, maybe i should take some computer classes and see how i like it. it turns out i love it. i didn't start a specific program, i've just picked classes that seemed fun, or could help me figure out what i would like to work with.

so far i've taken :

* functional programming in scheme
* data structures and algorithms
* computer architecture
* linear electronics
* electronic components
* biologically inspired computing
* a statistics class (already have it as an engineer, but felt like refreshing it)
* object oriented programming in java
* robotics (forward/inverse kinematics, ros, dynamics)
* os and network communication
* system development 

i am starting to feel the urgency of figuring what exactly i want to do professionally.
so far, i think my dream job would be to use my mech degree to build something, and add electronics to power it, and programming to control it, and ai to make it smarter. the thing is that all of these areas are pretty big on their own, and i feel like i should pick a domain to specialize, but i don't really want to! i want to build stuff and have fun, and get payed to do it!

i've tried to make a website, and that was super fun! but i don't want to specialize as a full-stack developer. i've made some simple electronics stuff, but i don't have the time to take all the classes needed to feel super comfortable working with it (embedded, signal, analogue, digital sampling etc.). same with the other areas actually. many interesting classes, little time.

i'm going to spend the summer working on projects that include many of the mentioned domains to figure out if i can exclude something so that i can focus on something else, but i doubt it will be easy. it's all so much fun!

are there any jobs (beside youtuber) where i can work with many different hats? my imagination brings me to start-ups, but i wouldn't mind being part of something bigger for the social aspect as well as the possibility of being mentored. however i have the impression that in a big company i will end up specialized working in a limited area of expertise. 


any part-time possibilities where i can use my skills? 

any tips on which classes i should take in the future? i am currently thinking about:

* more statistics (to build on ai domain)
* advanced python (to be more confident in programming)
* databases (maybe i can learn this on my own)
* digital signal processing
* stochastic systems (kalman filter seems cool)


i might come across as i don't really know what i am doing, and you might be right. so far my guide has been my heart. i think it is time for some more structure as to how i am proceeding with my career, but i am having trouble figuring out what direction i want to go, and what direction i *can* go.

we have the force of gravity and my weight (150lbs). friction primarily is from air and the axis/suspension joint to an i-hook. dampening could be caused by air, fabric stretch, etc. period is determined by the center of gravity vs the distance from the axis. 

ball bearings at the end of the suspension ropes might help.

a simple clockwork mechanism could add back the friction losses of air and the ball bearings.

aquarium glass calculators and aquarium forums indicate that in choosing glass thickness only height of the aquarium matters. they say that pressure increase with increasing the height of the glass, and hence the need for thicker glass. still they are not speaking anything about the increased force on the front, side, and back glasses by increasing the length and width of the tank.  i think that with just increasing the length and width the force that water exerts on all side glasses increase because of higher volume. this should also be considered when picking glass thickness.

i have to admit that even though i have 0 clue about what’s actually happening, it’s extremely interesting for me to think about the fact that, at one point, the car or the airplane or the truck or the rocket was just an abstract idea in someone’s head that they made real by and through engineering and engineering practices.

the sex machine already has a power supply box with a speed controler attached to it, so would i be able to just wire up the motor shown in the link above and just plug it straight in to the power supply box and if so sould the controller even manage to control a motor spinning at such high rpm? pictures of the box are here:

i'm a mechanical design engineer with 2 years experience at one of those big ol' aerospace companies. 

at first, my job was really awesome because they gave me this really cool design project. as far as i know, i did very well with that project. got everything done on time and did my own analysis to ensure that it only went through stress verification once. of course i made mistakes, but i was always able to recover and get my shit back on track. management seemed saturdays.

but since that ended, my job has been damn near 90% paper work. even the ""engineering tasks"" haven't been very engaging.

i believe that this is happening because there is no real design work to be done, but only sustainment work for old equipment. 

i'm at a point where the work feels very basic and repetetive, and i'm not growing as an engineer or professional.

should i count my lucky stars that i am even in aerospace and just keep chugging, or should i consider leaving the industry to seek more technical work that allows me to develop and grow as an engineer? i'm wondering how hard it would be too get back into the industry later, if i leave to seek some meaningful professional growth.

so i am looking at this pump:

http://www.novaeuro.com/?a=produkty&opcja=show&idprod=334&idkat=8&idpodkat=23

for the connectors i have i need at least 0.5 bar, and the attachments are ~80cm above the pump.

i looked around and [found a calculator that converts from `meters head` to `bar`](https://www.convertunits.com/from/meter+of+head/to/bar) and if i put in the max height of the pump (2.5m) it tells me that the pressure is 0.2451034858 bar, which is presumably at ground level. 

so that's nowhere near what i need, which is kinda surprising. the strongest pump in this range only has a `meter head` of ~3.5m and i need ~5m to get 0.5bar (at ground level?!)

what kind of power pump would i need to get 0.5bar at ~80cm?

at first i liked my job, i felt like i was learning new things and had a variety of tasks. fast forward to today, i feel like i have learned everything there is to learn for my position, all the problems that can occur i know how to fix and the ""variety of tasks"" has turned into a monotony. my daily tasks are; generating / correcting sops, responding to emails, getting quotes, keeping an eye on operations, identifying problems with equipment and getting maintenance to fix them. some days i stare at a computer screen all day . i am not challenged, i feel like a glorified secretary and i have not done a single ""engineering"" type task since starting. every time i have tried to contribute to a project or engineering discussion i am ignored. sometimes other, more experienced, engineers reach the same conclusion that i already expressed but i get no credit and am still not invited to future discussions.

i would like to work with data, or design or project management or be included in strategic meetings, but (although those tasks take place) i am not included in them. i have expressed my interest in taking on more responsibilities and my general dissatisfaction with my job to my boss multiple times but nothing changes, he feel that being a computer jockey is what an engineer ""should do"" for the first 2-3 years before they are ""allowed"" to do engineering. is this normal sentiment? for what it's worth, i was told i was exceeding standards in all categories on my performance review expect communication, which was only meeting standards.

what is the norm at other workplaces for new engineers? does manufacturing get any better? is it just my employer? i have considered changing industries or employers but it's pretty hard to get interviews with only 1 year experience. i am also considering getting a phd, i feel like that would allow me to do data analytics and have my opinion matter.

right - i want to preface this by saying i don't really ever do projects like this, so if i seem like an idiot, that's probably because i am. maybe it isn't possible, i dunno, but i would love it if anyone had any ideas.

so i've got this replica of excalibur - https://ibb.co/gckw8n. i want to try and create a functional sword in the stone, and by functional, i mean there needs to be some sort of device integrated into the construction that allows two modes - one where you can easily slide the sword out of the top, and one where it will not move even with the application. the sword is probably about 2.5 feet long and weighs approx. 8kg. it is blunt.

originally, i was planning on just planning on doing a craft where you could slide it out whenever, but this would be much cooler. the original plan consisted of:
-some sort of wooden base (to stop it falling over, it's heavy)
-cutting up some styrofoam and sticking it all together to put on top of the base
-modelling clay on the outside, painted to look like a rock

anyway, i'm trying to think of ways to construct and integrate a device (and that might mean the plan above being heavily altered) into the construction to allow the bi-functionality.

these diagrams are terrible, i'm a geneticist, not an engineer, but my initial two ideas were:
-https://ibb.co/cbxutn, having some sort of circular ""clamp"" that could be tightened around the blade using a cord. i realised after i drew this that i wouldn't have a way to unclamp it so i think that sucks.
-https://ibb.co/evrajn, ok, so then i was thinking about a more complicated frame to hold a device that would clamp the sword from either side, some sort of button, i dunno.

i have had a previous engineering internship for approximately 10 months but it was mostly project and design engineering where i would design the parts and create drawings for them. i do not, however, know how to apply proper tolerancing or gd&t and i wonder if this is something that will be taught on the job or whether i should expect to have to learn it on my own.

i really want to be successful here and i hope that some engineers could give me pointers on things i will be expected to know before i start this position.

b\) to get street cred with the degree for taking on larger problems

have i said, i love solving engineering problems and learning about anything science/engineering! given that, i would want to stay in engineering/product type role.

0,Leaving my First job before being there even 1.5 years,1,31,37,1524882840,"leaving my first job before being there even 1.5 years i graduated from college and spent about 8 months looking for a job after graduation.

i have been at this job for just under a year and a half.  while working there i have done various projects, but many of them seem to be started, and then stopped to work on another ""hotter"" project (this seems to happen to most engineers).

i am on the standards team and haven't been doing much standardizing of things, and even what i suggest takes a long time to implement (see example below).  i have been getting a bit annoyed i guess with management, and how nothing really seems to be changing at any decent speed.

last week a recruiter emailed me and since i have been annoyed and working overtime i figured i would look into it.  i had the interview and spoke with the company and they verbally gave me an offer.

i would be making ~20% more money (i am making 51k, new job is at 60k)
the commute is 5-10 min farther (about 30 min so still fine with me)
my current position i am doing mechanical engineering and supposed to be standardizing their machines.  i am fairly decent at this and do enjoy my work, just not the management and poor procedures.
the new position would be a mix of mechanical, process control, and electrical engineering.  this would allow me to gain much more experience.  i have done some process control during a co-op and a bit at my current job, and the electrical is high-level stuff (making sure a 24v thing gets 24v and not 240v, or 480v basically).  i have done a bit of that at my current job as well.  neither of those two fields though am i strong in, and that is making me hesitate.

any advice for me?
is it bad to be leaving a job because of management after such a short time?
how do i actually leave if i decide to because i have no idea?
should i ask the company to write up the offer for me before bringing it up at my current job?
anything that i am missing?


tldr;
my current job has shitty process making me work overtime/saturdays.  i have suggested improvements but they take very long for simple things.  i am annoyed by it, but like the actual work, i do.  the new job would give me 20% raise and would have a much rounder experience (mechanical, process, and electrical).


example:
the current job i work at makes what they call subassemblies, which is a bunch of parts that are mated in the model and just kinda float there.  to show how the parts actually go onto the machine they take the model number and make a ""-detail"".  then they use that ""-detail"" for their drawings, while the other model is for the bill of material for their parts system.

i started my 2nd week making a model, and wasn't taught how they do things, so i saw the end product and was like ohh yea i remember this from school then used an ""envelope"" for the frame to keep it out of the bom.  i went through and finished up the drawing and the checker thought it was good.  maybe a month-month and a half later someone looked at the model and can down to tell me i was wrong in doing it that way and to follow procedure on how to make it.
during the next engineering meeting i brought up my way and asked everyone why we don't do it that way, no one had any answer, the head engineer told me to look into it some more.  so i did, next meeting, told to look into it more again, next meeting, they decided to do it, and i will do training during the next meeting.  well, i think 3 more meetings went by until i did the training (i was ready the first one).  during those 3 meetings, i brought up another way to help speed up our large models (speedpak).  well after i did training, they decided to see how well speedpak works with envelopes (it doesn't matter, still works fine).  i spent a month or two trying to get time to look into speedpak more to find the best way for us to implement it.
then once i was ready again they pushed back my training to show everyone how to do it.

so total i suggested to use ""envelopes"" which is a very simple change that improves our drawing, and models by making the mates correct and parts no longer floating, and it took about a year for them to start implementing it.  i think me and another engineer are the only two who do it though.

i accepted and have  been working for the company for about 1.5 months. after my first week  it became clear that build team was really more of a technician role  \(everyone else on build team had applied to a technician position\). the  vast majority of the work that i've done so far has been assembling  prototypes, and several people have refereed to me a technician. overall  i feel like i was actively deceived into taking the position \+ a mix of  frustration and embarrassment that this will tarnish my resume.

i  recently spoke with my direct supervisor about this, who insisted that i  was doing really good work, and that i could do very well at the  company if i stuck around. they also said that they ""don't really  consider me the same as other build team members who's job is to  assemble things and not ask questions."" there is no precedent for  technicians/build team members becoming full fledged engineers, and i  have been given slightly more interesting work since bringing it up, but  no clear action from a managerial standpoint.

0,Does engineering bring you *fulfillment*?,1,19,37,1524011122,"does engineering bring you *fulfillment*? i'm a 2nd year civil engineering student. i went into the degree because it was the highest academically ranked course i could get into, thought it would make me rich and happy but its appearing to do the opposite.

most of my classmates tell me they really enjoy engineering. they all talk about how rewarding it is to finally understand a difficult concept. their leisurely discussions often revolve around engineering concepts and they seem to genuinely enjoy doing physics/maths, some students even watch maths related videos on youtube for fun. 

for me, engineering has never been enjoyable. i've never enjoyed maths or physics, engineering is the last thing i'd ever do in my free time. i'm interested in things such as marketing/psychology/behaviour economics, when i talk to most other engineers about these things their expressions are blank, i get along much better with business/psychology even law students. 

after a long group study session, my friends leave the library with a look of fulfillment whereas i feel tortured by boredom, our contrasting emotions also highlight my dissatisfaction. 

for example, after learning laplace's theorem last week, my friends non-sarcastically exclaim ""wow, that was so dope, it's actually so interesting, i can finally do more problems now"" while they go home excitedly to review the concept again. to fit in, i used to feign enthusiasm and say similar things but i realized i couldn't believe it no matter how much i lied to myself. now, i just keep quiet and think ""wow, i'm one step closer to never having to do this boring shit ever again in my life, one theorem down, twenty more to go, god help me grind through this boring ass subject so i can get a high paying job to achieve financial independence and retire at 35 to drink champagne with supermodels on my yacht in fiji""

another incident that left an impression on me was when i found these videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqfshcxzrle   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fssjcjoib7a  and showed them to my engineering classmates. 

i had a mini-breakdown after watching those videos because i realized that i would be a terrible civil engineer, having to look at maps all day and do mathematical formulas, i would be either extremely depressed or get fired for poor concentration and performance. on the other hand, my friends say ""yeah that looks cool"" they're genuinely content with doing mathematical formulas and analyzing maps all day - something which would make me depressed.

the biggest problem for me is that civil engineers don't make a lot of money despite all the time they spend studying and working. other engineering students don't seem to mind though, perhaps they find fulfillment in engineering alone or their family is already very wealthy (mine isn't).

civil engineers have a starting salary of around $55,000 with a slow progression to 6 figures. i work part time in a sales job at a tech startup and i could easily make $60,000 in my first year if i work full-time, given my current performance, i have a very good chance of earning 100k within 2 years. also, i don't need a degree to enter sales and i enjoy it 100x more than civil engineering. 

right now, dropping out of engineering to study business or going straight into work seems like a no-brainer to me. 

has anyone themselves been in a similar situation, and/or know someone who has?

i'm a design engineer and i feel like 90% of my time is spent on drawing maintenance. changing a note or annotation here and there.

in the few months i've contributed improvements by making parts more manufacturable and easier to assemble by making design changes or coming out with new designs. but that's a small minority of my time. and it's mostly me proactively proposing ideas as drawimgs come across my desk for me to modify a note or two, not being ""assigned"" to change the design. 

even though both jobs were product development, i am much much more insulated from decision making at my new job than my old. most times i am told what the decisions were without even me knowing that a discussion had occurred.

our job as application engineers requires a lot(10-20%) of commissioning and starting up our products in the field. sometimes this could be an hours drive for half a day, sometimes it could be a weeks worth of work half way across the us. anyways with going to school during the nights meant that he wouldn’t be able to travel for the week long trips( he still did the local ones). he mentioned that to the engineering manager and all seemed well but i guess this catches up when you have a lot of commissioning work and could only do the local ones. 

anyways he was let go this morning. kinda at a loss as he was someone we looked up to and was extremely well experienced (8 years with this company). kinda makes me scared as i’m doing my masters degree part time as well.

i want to work for this company for a lifetime. i would like to spend my career there and i really want to do what it takes to succeed. i do understand, however, that three months over the summer is not very much time to prove myself entirely. can you guys give me any insight as to what you look for in interns and how i can stand out? how do you stay organized? what tips do you have for someone starting out their career that you wish you knew when you had started?

the typical tasks for this position would be the following

>reviewing and approving drawings for production

>identifying and implementing process improvements/advancements and reporting status

>establishing data collection methods. learning and applying understanding of variation and statistical analysis to ensure process robustness.

>creating and releasing process documentation and process specific interpretation

>providing real-time analysis of quality drivers, non-conformances, performance, customer escapes and inefficiencies

some of the requirements for the position were as follows:
>exceptional written and verbal communications skills

>customer focused

>ability to perform on task and be able to handle multiple projects at once

>attention to detail

most of my experience from my previous internship has been reverse engineering and part design and drafting, writing project documents (ssas, pmas, pscps, etc) for faa approval, finding standardized parts to reduce production costs.

if you're looking for engineers to interview for a school assignment or for your job hunt, this is the right place! the askengineers community has compiled a list of hundreds of practicing engineers across different countries, industries, and specializations to help answer your questions about what they do in their job, how they got there, and offer career advice to those that need it.

**note:** please be courteous when requesting an interview. everyone on the list is doing it on a volunteer basis only, and they are not obligated to respond or help you. our users reserve the right to deny any requests for interviews and/or personal information. harassment will not be tolerated and will be reported to the authorities.

###how to use this list

1. `ctrl + f` the engineering discipline, country (e.g. us, uk, germany, etc.), or other criteria you're looking for looking for. if you need to be able to verify someone's identity, search for ""available for e-mail?: yes""

1. parse through each search result and message 2-3 users that you think will be able to answer your questions. **please do not shotgun pms to every user!** if you don't intend to interview everyone, don't waste their time by sending messages that you won't respond to later.

1. if the first few users don't respond within 24 hours, try messaging another user.

---

###interested in conducting interviews?

by signing up, you're volunteering to let high school students, prospective engineers, and new graduates pm or e-mail you with interview questions. typically with students it will be for a class assignment (i.e. intro to engineering), so questions will be about about work, how you got into engineering, ""do you have any advice for..."", etc. think of yourself as a stem ambassador. you will receive anywhere from 1-4 requests per month on average, with some surges in january, july, august, and december due to new and graduating students. while these lists usually have over 100 sign-ups and is set to contest mode, which prevents the same users from getting bombarded with requests, engineers in an in-demand discipline may get more requests than average.

####requirements

1. **at minimum, you should have:**
  * a bs / b.sc in engineering or engineering technology, or an equivalent amount of self-study, and;
  * at least 2 years of professional experience in an engineering industry

1. **commit to answering at least two interview requests per month**. don't list your information if you aren't willing to dedicate ~2 hours per month to conduct interviews.

1. **this is purely on a volunteer basis.** to opt out, delete your comment here below. once deleted, you will no longer receive requests for interviews.

####how much time does it take?

the first interview you do will take about 1 hour, depending on how detailed you are. after that, most interviews will take < 30 minutes because you can copy-paste answers for repeat or very similar questions. that said, please be sure to read every question carefully before using previously written answers. it's your call on how personal or impersonal you want to be in your answers

####how do i sign up?

copy the template below and post a top-level comment below. **note:** ""available for e-mail"" means you're ok with the interviewer sending you a personal e-mail to conduct the interview, usually for verification purposes. if you want to stick to reddit pm only, answer 'no' to this question.

    **discipline:** mechanical

    **specialization:** power turbines

    **highest degree:** msme

    **country:** us

    **available for e-mail?:** yes/no

i don’t want my years of medical training and experience to go to waste either. so my question is - what kind of biomedical engineering jobs are out there? is there a large demand for engineers that are also doctors? am i just dreaming when i think that i could have a unique and desirable skill set if i go through with this?

0,Going From Management Back To Engineering?,1,63,19,1521932378,"going from management back to engineering? has anyone here gone from engineering into management and back into engineering?  best decision ever?  worst?

i'm a (late 30's/early 40's) first line engineering manager (i directly manage ~20 engineers from several disciplines) of 3-5 years at a big well respected company that you have all heard of.  i really like the work my team does and the products we build.  they really do inspire me, everyone around me, and many people around the world.  the company has been extremely good to me over the years and i have absolutely nothing to complain about in terms of compensation, benefits, etc.  that's all really great.  i like working with, developing, and advocating for my engineers.  and i like getting shit done.  i'm really good at driving execution and efficiency (getting projects done on time and on budget or better), but honestly not that good with (or interested in) formulating strategy and selling it.  i have a ""no bullshit"" attitude that hampers my ability to be diplomatic.

despite good performance ratings (i actually really like and get along well with my immediate boss), i'm honestly dissatisfied.  i don't believe i really have the right personality type for management.  i abhor the politics and the bureaucracy at my level and up the chain.  many hours of my week are spent in pointless mandatory management meetings reviewing the same materials over and over and over and over.  i'm often not empowered to make decisions without significant oversight.  lots of time is wasted on mundane topics and inability of my leaders to actually make decisions and stick to them (feels like decisions are often made in committee and then revisited continually in other committees).  i can feel my soul slowly being sucked out of me.  i have no desire to move up the chain (it's all politics up there).  but, since it's a huge company i might feel differently in a different division.  though thus far i have been unable (and not for lack of trying) to get a lateral move to another spot.  i have two different b.s. degrees in engineering and an mba.

i really just like working with numbers and analysis.  writing code.  improving tools and processes.  inventing new ways to interrogate the data.  i've always liked jumping between engineering disciplines and exploring new things.  i get bored pretty easily (2-3 years in one position is usually enough for me).  so i'm very seriously considering going back to engineering.  i wouldn't be the first but i've witnessed the stigma on those who have preceded me.  there is a big part of me that thinks of going back as ""failure"" - like i just couldn't hack it.  i could ride this job for 15-20 more years and have enough to comfortably retire, put my kids through college, etc, etc.  but sometimes i'm super jealous of my engineers.  they present results to me for approval, i provide feedback, i guide them on what they should be looking for, i help them w/ messaging, i look for opportunities to develop them and fill in gaps in their knowledge/experience, and that's awesome.  but i'd rather be doing the engineering work.  i want to be working along side w/ them - not catching up with them in short stints between bullshit meetings that have no measurable purpose.  i could still ""lead from the trenches"" without all the overhead and could probably add more value to the company.

i don't know.  i'm rambling.  thoughts on going back?  i'd really like to hear from others that have had similar thoughts or have actually done it.  it would help to know the situation, size of company, how it worked out, etc, etc.

however, even with many many checks, re-checks, tests, etc. unless you prove it mathematically (which i know can be done with software, not sure about engineering) you can never really be sure there are no bugs (e.g. spaceships, etc.) in software.

i looked up to try to find architectural errors and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/structural_integrity_and_failure) seems to list quite a few, however there are a lot of buildings in the world and most are not collapsing. whereas with software there is a lot of software and a lot of bugs.

0,I hate my internship and I could really use some advice.,1,77,45,1521188213,"i hate my internship and i could really use some advice. i hate my internship. i work at a small local aerospace company as a mechanical engineering intern. i am completing my third year of a bsme and i have been working as an intern for this company for 10 months. generally, i get a very large workload as i complete all of the company's design and drafting work as well as their engineering documents (ssas, pmas, pscps, qtps... etc). along with that, i am given constant daily tasks that often take precedent over many of my other assigned tasks.

i am often unable to complete projects because i am given so many at once and between this 24-30hr workweek in addition to taking fluid mechanics, heat transfer, machine design and fea, i feel immensely overworked at times. the company i work at is owned and run by 4 engineers and 3 of the 4 can be complete assholes at times and it makes it a very toxic place to be a part of. because i am given so much engineering work, i have had to learn so much at a very quick rate but i am often yelled at for making minor mistakes although i am learning. there is a language barrier with my boss, and he often underestimates the time it will take for me to complete his tasks. there is an absolute disconnect and i have tried to resolve it, but he is old school and doesn't give a shit. i feel i have learned a great deal, but its not necessarily what i would like to do as a career. i would rather work in components design or aero thermal fluids/ propulsion and i don't get to touch any of that here.

as stated, i have been here about 10 months now and i would really like to quit, but i don't want to look like i can't manage school and work together to potential employers. furthermore, i don't have any other internships lined up, but i am just generally pretty unhappy where i am at. i feel like i am learning, but my boss feels like i should be going home and learning on my own time and that if i need to take the time to understand things then i should clock out to learn and then clock back in. often times, i also feel as though i am unable to ask questions.

i don't get paid much ($15/hr) and i am the only intern. i haven't signed any co-op agreement stating i would be there for a certain length of time but the position is available to me until graduation in may of 2019 (granted i do ok).

**the pros** (if you were wondering whether there were any):

* it is close to my school and house

* i feel like i am learning, whether or not that will prove useful to my career pursuits in other facets of engineering is yet to be seen

* i like the technicians and shop floor, and one of the engineers is pretty cool

* i get to solve engineering problems daily!

**the cons**

* boss is a dick

* engineers can be dicks

* it's a toxic work environment at times between the bosses and shop floor

* often given too much work and not enough time to complete tasks

* i don't have a ""mentor"" or anybody i can go to for questions

* i often get chewed out/insulted for being ""too slow"" (i'm not lazy and i'm really trying!)

* i am pretty overworked between school and work, and it seems like cutting my work hours is not an option

**is this what the industry is like?** i completely understand it may be common to work under pressure to meet deadlines and that the work will be challenging, but is everyone an asshole? this is my first internship so it is my first exposure to the engineering field.
i am a pretty decent student with a 3.4 gpa cumulative and a 3.67 gpa major, but i feel like this internship may take a toll on my grades this semester (i believe i'll pass with a few b's and a c).

overall, do you think quitting without another internship lined up (i've been trying and interviewing) would be a bad idea? my professor told me that it may look like i couldn't manage my time well enough between school and my internship to future employers.

also, i should mention, i don't think i would work my senior year anyway because of the massive courseload between senior design and my classes.

however, i would imagine that there must be a point of diminishing returns, given that field strength declines with distance from the conductor.  ordinarily, each turn generates a magnetic field that reinforces and adds to the field generated by all the other turns.  however, if you imagine a coil with a 1 mile diameter, surely there must be no field strength left by the time you reach the center of the coil.

so what is this limit?  is there an equation, rule of thumb, or plot that tells you where an increase in area no longer provides a linear response in inductance, and where that point of diminishing returns is where increasing the area further causes a *decrease* in inductance?

i am a homeowner and currently under construction on my first home (primary). i've hired a general contractor who in turn hired a subcontractor to do the foundation. the subcontractor poured concrete in the forms without getting the rebar and forms inspected by the city. the city is now requiring (and rightfully so) that a structural engineer sign off on the foundation and to have the foundation xrayed. my general contractor is having a structural engineer come out this monday the 12th. i want this foundation ripped out and a new contractor to come in and do it right. the general and the sub contractor are telling me its okay and it wont have to be ripped out (i dont believe them). i've spoken to two structural engineers here in the local area, they say given the situation they wouldn't sign off on it.  please review  the following album:

[images of concrete/foundation](https://imgur.com/a/5wo71)

my concern is what if this structural engineer who has been hired by general contractor has been paid under the table to pass the foundation? i dont see how this foundation passes. 

**code violations** - code violations refer to the 2017 oregon residential specialty code

* code - r109.1.1:  foundation inspection - concrete poured with no inspection. 

* code - r403.1.5.3.3: support and cover - there are at least 7 areas where there is exposed rebar to the elements  in the footings. 

**non-code violations** - considered  “not good practice”

* wooden stakes left in footings - over time these stakes will rot out and create voids in the footings, weakening the structure. the wooden stakes were used to support the forms for the stem walls so that they could do a monolithic pour. talking with various people, most foundations are done in two pours - one for the footings (providing time to cure) and later one for the stem walls. this would have prevented wooden stakes from being in the footings.   

* concrete not vibrated during pours - cold seams developed in the concrete between the two pours and concrete has a swiss cheese look to it. many air pockets exist.

* forms removed less than 24 hours after pour during very cold weather (below 32 degrees).

1) my laptop is a $600 hp pavilion. i use it on a daily basis, but it’s kinda slow and crashes and glitches out sometimes, and screeches at me when it overheats, so i was considering upgrading to a dell xps or something of that caliber. however, i’m not certain that i could justify a purchase like that, as most of my use is confined to word/excel/firefox with only infrequent use of matlab/solidworks/eclipse and even less frequent gaming. and from what i’ve read on other posts, the general consensus seems to be that having a great computer isn’t super important in a mechanical engineering discipline.

2) i have a bunch of small-engine type projects that i work on as a hobby. one of them is a nice little 1967 honda ct90 which i’ve repaired in all but the paint. i was eyeball quoted around a grand to give it a professional paint job if i handled the disassembly and reassembly myself. i would love to splurge on that, but obviously that wouldn’t really provide much benefit to me aside from pretty pictures for my linkedin ;) 

ideally i would like to spend money on something that will benefit me as a student or as a future engineer. my first thought was just getting some better technology, but i feel maybe i’m just not thinking creatively enough! 

what would you guys spend < $2000 on to improve your life in the context of school/career if you had the opportunity? i’d really appreciate any thoughts you have!",64,1854,13,332

for example, in many of my group projects, i tend to mess up on small things that cascade into bigger problems. like miscalculating a reaction force that starts fucking up everything later down the line, but no one catches it until its too late. then, we have to go back and re-do everything. my group mates have never been mad at me when this happens, but i feel like i am a useless burden. i also tend to feel very slow when it comes to solving problems, like, stopping bars from buckling. i'm worried that i will end up under-performing when i get out into the industry, and that when i propose solutions, they end up causing damages to the company rather than solving anything. 

i have a very high gpa, but that means nothing. i suck at using my hands in manufacturing, and i am decent at cad though there are many others that are better than me. i don't know, i just don't feel like i'm ready and the nightmare scenario of doing poorly in my job and then getting fired, and then never being able to find another engineering job is troubling me.

i'm very bad at reducing waste and identifying the root cause of manufacturing defects. a product will have a recurring defect that causes it to be unsellable and i'm at a loss for what to do to fix it. i try to breakdown the steps it takes to be manufactured through the plant. my next step is to identify possible things that could be going wrong and then investigate them, but typically i don't find anything wrong that sticks out to me. then i'm left guessing about what it could be and i start to change processes to see if it fixes anything. i feel like i'm going in circles instead of solving anything.

i'm currently a 4th year student at a top 10 school in the us, graduating in december. my focus is in electromagnetic fields and waves, especially for rf applications. after graduation, i'd like to work in industry for ~two years to get some experience and to save up money for pursuing my master's abroad. germany has been my top prospect for a while because of their free public tuition and engineering reputation.

now, i understand that quite a few companies offer tuition reimbursement for pursuing your master's at a local university while working. nonetheless, the desire to study/live abroad is something that, even if it doesn't necessarily make the most financial sense, i've been wanting to do for both personal reasons and as a chance to continue my education - all while i'm still in my early twenties. after getting a master's, i'd ideally like to stay in the eu to find employment.

which brings me to the title question: if i return to the us afterwards, would having pursued an international master's program be a red flag for defense companies? i understand that a lot of rf jobs are in defense, and should there be problems with getting a clearance, i'm a little worried my employment prospects would be unduly limited.

again, these are all hypothetical considerations for something that is at least 4-6 years away, but i'd still like to hear y'all's perspective. while on the topic, have any of you finished your bachelor's in the us, then went abroad for grad school (or know someone who has)? what was your motivation, and did it pay off?

i was hoping for some outside advice/feedback.
i work in one of the larger consulting firms in toronto, canada. i have been an employee for 6 years now, starting as an eit and rising the ranks to the title/role of project manager on large scale municipal infrastructure projects. i love my job and role, and have been flagged as a high performer by management. as a result i have been offered shares, and given unique opportunities including overseas placements. management is generally nice, and i feel appreciated and respected for the work i do.

the only issue i have is salary. during performance reviews, i have always been commended for my work and given rankings of exceeding expectations. however, when requesting raises, i have been told that my years of experience is the limiting factor for my salary. all of the other municipal engineering project managers in my division/ office have 10+ years of experience, and are receiving compensation packages much larger than me despite me completing the same role/ having the same billable rate to clients. i have been told that i should look at the big picture and the experience i am gaining rather than salary at this point in my career, but i feel i am unsure if i am selling myself short.

i currently make $78,500/year. i have consulted opse salary surveys and recruiters/friends in the industry and have heard i should be in the range of $90-100.

does this number sound like a reasonable pay expectation, or am i being overzealous? does my current management/company have a point about the years’ experience?

0,"I loved my job, and then I got my performance review... :(",1,145,115,1519935290,"i loved my job, and then i got my performance review... :( 

hello,

 

this is part venting, part asking for feedback. i like hearing the thoughts of more experienced engineers.

 

i am a level 1 mechanical design engineer at one of the big aerospace contractors. i received my bsme two years ago, and began working here 1.5 years ago in a non-engineering role. i used this role to network with engineers, which led to engineering assignments, and as of ten months ago, a job as a mechanical design engineer. i love being a design engineer, especially in aerospace.

 

**tl/dr:**

i thought that i did well on a recent project that i took over from a senior engineer. i delivered on an aggressive deadline, but haven’t been given much else to do, despite me asking for work. performance evaluation basically seemed to say that i don’t deserve to make as much as a new grad because i haven’t done much work and i have made mistakes/am not perfect. i am legit bothered by this and want clarification beyond vague negative statements that amount to “you suck.”

 

 

**context:**

 

when i transitioned to my current department, there was virtually no training. i was replacing a level 3 engineer, so they gave me one of his projects. it wasn’t terribly complicated, but it was my first, and it was a very rewarding challenge. i loved it and i’m grateful that they gave me the opportunity. the deadline was aggressive and i took the project over in the middle. due to changing information from other teams, i had to completely redesign the thing from what was originally given to me. i also used some experience from my previous position to make case for an additional test that no one seemed to realize was necessary. upon discussing my concern with leadership, they agreed that the simple special case test i was suggesting was a good idea. i completed the project on time and under budget, but not without my share of silly mistakes. still, i received no indication that my performance was sub-par. since then, real work has been pretty sparse. i’ve told my leaders that i’ve got bandwidth, but my manager just says there isn’t much right now and he’ll get me some meaningful work soon. i have no reason to not believe him.

 

 

**situation:**

 

when i transitioned over from the old position, i was given a raise, but it still wasn’t enough to bring me up to market for an entry level engineer. i did ask for 5% more, but they wouldn’t budge. i accepted any way figuring i’ll see what happens when performance review comes around. that time has come. i would have been happy with a 3% raise, which would have put in in a range commiserate market for a new grad. the actual raise was far lower (less than inflation) and, frankly, i feel insulted. call me entitled, but i figure that after 10 months, i should at least be making as much as a new grad. the manager himself told me what they typically offer new grads, and they are using my previous salary to justify paying me a full 5% less than what they typically pay a new grad.

 

i told myself that i’d be ok with this before the evaluation, but the more i think about the feedback on my performance, the more i just feel like firing up my resume. the feedback was almost all very vague, negative stuff about me not having attention to detail, needing to read up on some program documentation, and not being aggressive enough in finding work. he even hinted that i was downright dishonest about some things. my thoughts on this feedback; i agree that i miss things sometimes, but i’ve also caught important things that my leadership has missed. this meeting was also the first time i had heard of the documents that my manager seems to think i should have read already, so i’m not sure how i could have known to read them without being telepathic. also, i absolutely did let leadership know that i was available for new work. i didn’t receive much attention. i could walk around with a sign and a megaphone, making certain that leadership is keenly aware, at all times of day, of my full bandwidth, but that is stupid. finally, not sure what the hint about dishonesty was about. i probably was wrong about something out of pure ignorance, and they thought i was trying to cover my ass. any how, i emailed the manager, asking for more detail on my performance issues. i haven’t gotten a response yet.

 

 

**conclusion:**

 

i always try to remain objective and avoid the ol’ self-serving bias. the feedback really bothers me a lot more than the salary. i put a lot of work and thought into the project. i am either insanely incompetent and no one has the heart to tell me, or i should look for a new job.

 

i think the most likely cause is that they just don’t really know how to develop a new engineer. i know that it is ultimately my responsibility to develop my own skills/competence, but i’m not a psychic. some guidance is necessary if they want me to read up on specific documentation that is scattered around in 10 layers of folders on the company server. i don’t think that they are bad people. my leadership is, in fact, quite delightful and i enjoy them. but i am having a hard time accepting their feedback as anything more than half truth, and am frustrated by the lack of specific information regarding my shortcomings.

i've always wondered why every thermostat i've ever encountered has to be manually flipped from heating to cooling.  in the spring and autumn, temperature can fluctuate between below and above room temperature, even within one day.  to me, it would seem trivial to design thermostats to simply keep your house in an acceptable range - for example if the temp goes below 68f turn on the heating, and if it goes above 72f turn on the cooling.

granted i have not used ""smart"" thermostats yet, i assume they do have this ability.  but i think even a ""dumb"" thermostat ought to be smart enough to do this since it's about as simple of a calculation as you can program.

so i'm going to ask some very, very basic questions, and hopefully i can use the answers to understand the answers in the lecture notes. in some cases i *think* i know the answer, but want to know for certain before it makes me misunderstand something. thanks in advance for your time. 

what are poles?

what is an impulse?

what is a domain?

what is an s-plane?

what is k? more accurately, how does it relate to gain?

the root locus diagram plots the damping factor (r) against the oscillating frequency (theta). i understand that the damping factor make systems less sensitive to input, but what does oscillating frequency control? and why does there need to be a separate value for damping, when k makes the system *more* sensitive to input, so why can't you reduce k instead of increasing r?

i'm really stuck deciding which discipline to pick.

mechanical engineering seems interesting to me because i want to design robots and automated machines. i really want to study the physical but i also want to work with sensors and programming to make these machines come alive.

 i have this image that mechanical engineers design the machine and the electrical engineers bring it to life. in this sense, i want to go into electrical engineering, but i don't have any interest in the more electrical only subjects that have no application to real moving parts, for example, communications, signals, electrical power, etc.

i enjoyed studying mechanics and i also enjoyed working with electrical circuits. the electrical labs were much more interesting, and i enjoyed designing a circuit that controlled the movement of a robot on treads.

i would like to keep working with circuits. however, i really want to study machines. i like boolean logic especially, in fact, i want to focus on boolean logic and control. but only in relation to physical systems, like temperature control, movement of mechanical parts, etc.

it really seems like i can't choose one without leaving something behind that i really want to learn. choose mechanical engineering and i lose the programming, circuitry, boolean algebra. choose electrical engineering and i lose the real world context and machines.

also, i cannot take mechatronics, as it isn't offered at my university.

0,Seasoned MEs and EEs: What are your favorite interview questions for candidates?,1,40,97,1518498265,"seasoned mes and ees: what are your favorite interview questions for candidates? in the course of my last three jobs i've performed dozens of interviews. first for a company i founded several years back, later for small businesses (<50 employees).


in the first two cases, my general strategy was to look over a resume and portfolio, ask specific questions about specific aspects of past work, and gauge how knowledgeable the candidate was. i prefer to feel out a candidate's intuition and grasp of engineering concepts rather than ask them to remember complex equations, on the theory that it's much easier to find the right equations (and know how to apply them) if you understand the underlying theory, rather than going the other way. 


anyway, the interview process in my current job is more structured and there is a series of interviews each addressing different things. for me and ee candidates i perform the technical part of the interview. traditionally (as a holdover from the last guy in this role) we ask candidates how they would design ""x"" system (each time a system *we* designed) and gauge their responses. i've never liked this approach, for a couple reasons. one, the questions are poorly worded and confusing, and it often takes 10 minutes just to get the idea across. with skype interviews it takes twice as long, and is frustrating for all involved. two, as they are designing we progressively add constraints, and inevitably these constraints push the applicant to reproduce our existing design, the way we designed it. i find that to be a poor way of gauging competency. 


with that in mind, i've re-structured my interview process to include a few things:


* conceptual questions: questions that do not require doing any math to solve if you understand the problem. some of these seem really simple and i'm almost embarrassed to ask them - except that so few candidates get most of them correct, so i persist. i.e. many grad students and experienced engineers still seem to think that the amount of force acting on a dam is a function of the volume of water behind it. 

* design questions: ""how would you design a system to achieve 'x.'"" they are sometimes but not often related to our actual work, and i like to throw out design problems most engineers haven't encountered outside of niche industries to see how they think about a problem.
 
* cad test: for now this involves dimensioning a part. i'll give a random part in solidworks and give them 15 minutes to create a dimensioned drawing. it's pretty easy to see if a candidate has had any real world gd&t experience. 


so with that in mind, i'd like to know how you guys/gals do this. are there any particular conceptual or design questions you're very fond of or that you consider particularly illuminating? do you ask calculation-intensive questions? 


i take these interviews seriously as i work for small companies and each new hire is a significant expense. not to mention that i work with these folks afterwards and i want to make sure our team is strong. if anyone would like to share their wisdom, i'd love to hear it!",80,3040,12,521

so here's my rough idea on paper and a bath chair that helped inspire the idea. 

i need a mostly friction less track for it to be on.  she's 3 and can bear weight on her legs during aqua therapy, and push up with her legs. 

so i wanted a way for her to exercise using the same motion with something that would help keep her knees in place and provide assistance that could be adjusted. 

i imagine her knees strapped into some skating knee pads that would be attached to some springs that would push to help make extending muscles in her legs easier.  the track would keep her in place and need straps to hold her into position (she has a gross motor delay). 

just reaching out wherever i can to help workshop this, let me know if i'm in the wrong place to ask this and possibly where else i can go. 

here's another project i put together for her a while back to help her learn to use her wheelchair.  she loves it!  i just want to do anything i can to help her. https://imgur.com/a/ecyee",174,1018,34,193

so that's what stuff i am already doing in school and what i got at home. i really like the soldering, and i wanna build all kinds of electronic/electrical things. could i do low level welding as well? or at least, if i did it out back or in my garage instead of my room? or if my room has tile flooring, and i ventilate, would that be okay? i'd like to also build and program electronic mechanical things, like a robot spider, or a little car, or something. 

you know, i always wanted to try watchmaking, and not just deconstruct and rebuild premade watches, but i also want to try to make a really high quality watch myself, like grind and shape and polish all the pieces as much as i can with the tools/equipment i could afford with that budget.

or besides that, be able to do custom mods to my guitar or speaker, or maybe try to repair my damaged iphone, and maybe look for dead/old electronics/electrical appliances on craigslist and stuff and use my tools on those things to try to fix stuff or modify stuff. maybe make a custom guitar pickup, a sustainer pick like the fernandes or sustainiac, a smart-led system to light up the body or the frets?

0,"How does compensation work in an early-stage startup, and what are things to watch out for?",1,37,19,1516766446,"how does compensation work in an early-stage startup, and what are things to watch out for? i'm looking to change careers from my secure government engineering job of the last 7 years, to join the hardware start up community in my nearby big city.  however, i'm not too sure how compensation (salary+equity) really works.  i've done some research, and it seems like there's a lot to look out for.

right now, my compensation is very simple : salary+benefits+401k matching.  i have 1-2% cost of living adjustments every year, step increases (2-3% usually) every few years, and my career progresses by rising in grades.  if i stick with my job for another 10 years, i could retire pretty comfortably (~$1-1.2mm in assets).  boring, not mega-rich, but comfortable.

from what i've read, if i get involved in a startup, there are two situations:

**become a founder:**

this is where you can make the big bucks.  me, along with a group of colleagues become founders of a business.  we initially take no salary, but we own substantial equity in the company (20-30%).  we then seek funding from investors, either institutional or high-net worth individuals.  we work on our product or service for a number of years, while growing the company.  we seek larger amounts of funding and hire employees.  maybe in the future we start receiving cash flow from operation, maybe even turn a profit.  but ultimately we seek to ""exit"", through acquisition or ipo.  then the equity becomes worth $mm if all is successful.  this is very rare.

**become an early-stage employee:**

i join a startup as an employee, become employee number #(1-30). i take a salary, but it will be a pay cut (70-80%) of that of a large-company.  i will be offered equity, i will have to negotiate hard for it, and i will end up owning low-single digits percentage of the company (1%-4%).  i work for a number of years, negotiating pay raises every 6 months (not sure, 1-5%?).  if i stick with it, and the company is successful and exits (5-8 years), i'll receive a nice cash bonus ($50k-$200k) from my equity, while the founders and investors make the big bucks.  only if the company sells for >$100mm will my equity be life-changing.   

however, i have to watch out for all sorts of fine print involved (equity dilution, vesting, market-rate buybacks, vampire clauses) where the founders might try to screw me over.  or salary cuts.  or most likely, the company just goes out of business.

if i don't stick with the company, i can (and will probably have to) hop from company to company every 2 years..

is this all the case?

as a mid-career professional, is it even worth it to be involved in a startup if you're not a founder?  i guess that's my other concern.  the single-digit ownership (if that's correct), and fine-print don't seem worth it.  i can understand for the experience, or if you like the lifestyle.

1,[D] Are transformers overhyped?,1,108,125,1638959580,"[d] are transformers overhyped? i've been wondering about this for a pretty long time since i've never seen anybody say anything bad about transformers, while to me, they seemed pretty flawed from the moment i've read the paper. i'm in no way an ml expert. i'm only an aspiring phd student, who's not even specializing in nlp, so if i'm any way wrong i'd really like to hear it.

tl;dr: i believe that transformers are, in the long term, a pretty small contribution to the world of nlp, and may even be damaging due to shifting the focus of the research community in the wrong direction. why? they don't address the long-term dependency problem.

before transformers nlp used to be dominated by rnns and specifically the encoder-decoder architecture. in the case of translation, the encoder would encode the input sentence in a fixed-length vector and the decoder would then decode this vector into an output translated sentence. now transformers also use encoder-decoder architecture, but there is one big difference. for rnns, encoding and decoding actually happens at every step of the way. words (i know it's tokens but i'll call them words) are inserted sequentially into the rnn. for every single word, the encoder rnn had to look at the current encoding vector and the input word and then choose how to update the encoding vector in a meaningful way.

the problem with this approach, which i'll call long-term dependency, arises when the rnn has to look at a very long sequence of words. humans can easily distill the information that they've read and remember only the important bits, for example, the name of a character that was mentioned 5 pages ago. but rnn models had trouble encoding what happened 5 sentences ago. the research community starts solving this problem with the original attention paper, but then transformers come out.

so out comes the transformer and starts dominating the nlp world. what does the transformer do? it is a huge model that, when encoding simply takes 512 input words (or some other arbitrary number) and looks at all of them simultaneously. and it works wonders. look, the transformer can remember what happened 5 sentences ago because the previous 5 sentences combined have less than 512 words, hooray. can it remember what happened 10 sentences ago though? uh well... no. can we improve it in some way to solve the long-term dependency problem? well, we can be smart about which sentences we feed into it, but that means we still have to distill information from a large body of text so... we're back at the beginning.

it's obvious that we have to solve the long-term dependency problem if we ever hope to achieve human-like nlp models, and to me, it seems that transformers do nothing to solve this problem. so why are they dominating the field of nlp research? maybe the optimal solution will include a combination of both the transformer and some other model for information distillation, but if we still need to solve the long-term dependency problem why are throwing out rnns so quickly?",31,3008,4,506

i’m sorry this is turning into an rant, it just really grates my nerves when people say they read something and in reality all they did was look at the abstract. 

i’m a firm believe that reading, comprehending and fully understand 1 single “key” paper from whatever field you’re studying, is a much better investment of your time than skimming through 100 regurgitated ideas.

edit: guys just to clarify, i do believe in skimming abstracts and looking for interesting papers. i go through dozens a day myself.  you’d be lost otherwise haha. i take issue though when someone claims they’ve “read” something when all they’ve done is gone through the abstract, and glanced through it.",52,1337,10,234

it seems to me that either people convert data to images and use image processing methods or use signal processing. does that mean signal processing is more lightweight and outperforms a prospective ml approach?",90,699,16,119

# the most popular data roles to consider

there is absolutely no doubt that the data industry is a promising landscape, offering great flexibility and generous employment opportunities. the market swarms with data-related jobs for all tastes, so sometimes it's really easy to confuse one with another.

if the multiplicity of data roles still puzzles you, i’ll be glad to navigate you among the most popular ones.

# must-have skillset to start a data career

before i start listing the highly demanded data professions, i’d also like to briefly describe the basic skill set required for these roles, which you should learn before sending your cv to potential employers.

to cut a long story short, your checklist to enter the data industry should include python, sql, and microsoft excel. trust me, you’ll hear these buzzwords at every interview :)

in addition, it’s a good idea to supply your armory with data visualization and data cleaning skills in order to unlock the door to a greater data career.

# most popular data roles: who’s who

* **data analyst**

***key focus***\*: performs analysis of business data to find beneficial opportunities.\*

in fact, no company can do without a data analyst, but their job titles usually vary from company to company. depending on the industry specifics, you may come across such titles as ""business analyst"", ""business intelligence analyst"", ""healthcare data analyst"" and so on,  but most of them relate to similar functionality.

as a rule, data analysts are engaged in collecting and analyzing data, as well as reporting outcomes to the company’s management in order to prioritize needs and target business strategies.

* **data engineer**

***key focus:*** *optimizes the infrastructure supporting the data analytics workflow.*

data engineers are responsible for building and testing optimal ecosystems that ensure worry-free data processing and the running of different algorithms. every piece of technology goes out of date and needs regular upgrades, so data engineers make sure that the current version of the system or platform is the most efficient one.

apart from hands-on experience with programming languages such as java, c++, and nosql, this position requires the ability to work with data apis and etl tools.

* **database developer**

***key focus:*** *ensures the proper functioning of databases.*

since databases are subject to processing massive datasets and experiencing high loads, database developers provide the full cycle of db maintenance, from modifying to backups and recoveries, in addition to designing and developing new databases.

additionally, the database developer workload includes ​​ensuring that all new business projects meet the existing database standards, and creating it documentation.

* **data architect**

***key focus:*** *creates the guidelines for data management within the company.*

the main goal of a data architect is to identify the end-use of the databases existing in the company. by writing detailed blueprints for all employees, data architects help to successfully coordinate the database integration, development, and testing as well as protect them according to the most contemporary security measures.

the most in-demand data architects should possess in-depth expertise in database structure and requirements, data mining, and segmentation techniques.

* **data scientist**

***key focus:*** *offers actionable business solutions and predictions through leveraging ai.*

in fact, the majority of data scientists start their careers as data analysts. speaking of the transition, the requirements that allow a data analyst to enter the data “ivy league” include mastering advanced programming skills and mathematics, as well as learning how to implement machine learning solutions.

data scientists are expected to collect data in order to perform predictive analysis, even on unstructured (unlabeled) datasets. they detect patterns and trends, and provide data-driven insights that can improve the decision-making process within the company.

* **chief data officer (cdo)**

***key focus:*** *leads the data workflows across the enterprise.*by crafting data strategy and overseeing data management, cdos ensure data quality and find ways of driving business processes in the right direction. as a cdo, you are engaged in establishing a “data-driven” culture that streamlines data sharing among the employees and making informed decisions on how to get more satisfying business outcomes.

# to sum up

more and more businesses nowadays increasingly recognize that they store treasure troves of data that, properly utilized, can be a great competitive advantage and bring value. as such, there has never been a better time to enter the data field because the demand for data specialists is skyrocketing, and organizations are willing to pay those who are able to convert data into a powerful business weapon handsomely.",31,5668,7,818

check out our modelplayground at: [https://hasty.ai/model-playground/](https://hasty.ai/model-playground/) – we'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

**aim**

we are building a smooth transition from our annotation tool to mlops for data-centric ml, as you cannot know *a priori* where improvements in performance will come from.

we believe in building a good process for ml dev ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-azxmwhjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-azxmwhjo)), rather than chasing sota. and we hate the ml frankensuite.

**problem**

when starting with hasty no one talked about data-centric ml, we had to learn our lessons the hard way. kostya, alex—my co-founders—, and i worked on several projects in the german industrial space and we felt the burn.

given our domain, standard approaches to jump-start learning with unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, synthetic data, gans, pre-trained models \[inset random technique here\], etc. weren't cutting it. so, we ended up spending evenings labeling data.

*there had to be a better way!*

**solution**

first, we build an annotation tool that scales up custom-trained models for annotation automation and qa – that is working well.

now, we are launching mp for you to be able to experiment, prep, and deploy models. bringing the worlds of ml ops and annotation together.",48,1412,8,187

**abstract:** we introduce the gansformer, a novel and efficient type of transformer, and explore it for the task of visual generative modeling. the network employs a bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image, while maintaining computation of linearly efficiency, that can readily scale to high-resolution synthesis. it iteratively propagates information from a set of latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the refinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of compositional representations of objects and scenes. in contrast to the classic transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of the successful stylegan network. we demonstrate the model's strength and robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor scenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality and diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efficiency. further qualitative and quantitative experiments offer us an insight into the model's inner workings, revealing improved interpretability and stronger disentanglement, and illustrating the benefits and efficacy of our approach. an implementation of the model is available at [https://github.com/dorarad/gansformer](https://github.com/dorarad/gansformer).

1,[D] The importance of the institution you study at. The story of a PhD student.,1,149,102,1614430542,"[d] the importance of the institution you study at. the story of a phd student. i saw quite a few posts lately regarding the issues faced by phd students or prospective students, so i wanted to add my rant on this too... of course, this is just anecdotal evidence and not all experiences are alike. yet, i feel that the situation may be endemic and representative from what i saw.

i got my phd a few months ago from an average european university. during my phd i've spent countless hours trying to get things done, mostly alone, with little or no holidays. in a way, the conferences were the only big major escape and chance to travel and clear my mind sort of. i feel for my peers that perhaps during the past year were unable to do so. of course, without having the budget of the big institution the only way for this to happen was to have a publication, and even then, often i had to take 16 hours flights with 2-3 changes instead of a direct 3-4 hours one due to budget constraints.

4 years later i got my phd and managed to publish around 10 papers in top venues (cvpr, iclr and the likes), most of them 2 authored (me and my supervisor), reflecting again the relative collaborative isolation that i feel happens in smaller universities.

so back to the original topic, did i felt that having the right network or being outside of the elite circle of universities matters? of course! a few major points:

* resources were always an issue. you need more gpus? not going to happen. what is worse while some of my peers with similar research work, both in terms of topic and research output got various grants from nvidia or amazon, i never even got a reply after filling their form.
* opportunities. 0 talk invitation (besides the presentations gave at conferences due to the publications), super-hard to get a research-focused internship. this while people from oxbridge, cmu, and the likes gave countless presentations even before having their first paper accepted. i am sure many of them, or perhaps all were great researchers, however not having the same opportunities do leave a sour taste.
* visibility. following on the above, it is pretty much impossible to compete on this with the big guys. let’s be honest, many people judge the work or make the decision of reading a paper based on the institution of the authors or wherever one co-author is famous. there are so many papers nowadays, so perhaps this is a reasonable thing, yet one that is affecting researchers from less known universities/companies disproportionately.
* job prospect. the more i apply, the more disappointed i get. i tried applying where everyone else wants to apply google, microsoft, facebook, amazon, etc. i never even got a reply after applying via their forms beyond the automatic ones. sure, it’s very competitive, but not even getting a reply? this is despite linkedin claiming that i am in the ""top 10% of applicants"" and me checking that their existing team has similar cvs with mine. i am starting to think that landing a job, or an interview at least with them requires an internal recommendation, that you can't get without a network, or having a star university/professor somewhere in your cv. in the latter case, you could likely get the first too anyway. it’s really hard to get the network when none at your university that you know of works at a top company and you are also not a social person generally. again i don't imply that they should run giving me a job, but i strongly believe my research output can warrant at least a reply back or interview, even if the answer is kind of no.

there are definitely more to this that can be piled up, but the main takeaway from my experience is that being a student outside of a select set of prestigious institutions has a set of harsh and real negative offsets that include the full spectrum, from resources to opportunities offered and job prospects.

where to next? unclear yet, i do like the work that i've done but i feel that all this effort didn't account for much in my prospective carrier and it feels very hard to break out of this loop. crashed dreams are perhaps the hardest thing to overcome.",79,4074,15,714

transformers are dominating deep learning, but their quadratic memory and compute requirements make them expensive to train and hard to use. many papers have attempted to linearize the core module: the attention mechanism, using kernels - for example, the performer. however, such methods are either not satisfactory or have other downsides, such as a reliance on random features. this paper establishes an intrinsic connection between linearized (kernel) attention and the much older fast weight memory systems, in part popularized by jürgen schmidhuber in the 90s. it shows the fundamental limitations of these algorithms and suggests new update rules and new kernels in order to fix these problems. the resulting model compares favorably to performers on key synthetic experiments and real-world tasks.

1,[D] Career Options/Advice with ML PhD,1,185,168,1614306991,"[d] career options/advice with ml phd (you can skip the first five paragraphs, or even just skip to the questions at the end if you don't feel like reading all of this)

**personal background and research struggles**

hi, i'm currently a 3rd year ml phd student at a top cs school and have been struggling with my research direction quite a bit. this has gotten me thinking about my future recently. given my position, i don't think a faculty job will be an option for me when i graduate, but i think i'd prefer to go into industry anyway. however, i've realized that i don't really have a good sense for what sort of career options i'll have after i graduate.

when i began my phd, i thought that i'd find a few research problems to work on, try to turn them into something publishable and eventually find an interesting niche or specific direction that i could push to turn into my dissertation (i had previous interests and prior work coming in of course, but i wasn't set on necessarily staying in the same topic, and didn't). i knew that i would work on seemingly-good ideas where the experiments would fall flat (or find proofs to be elusive, though i don't work on theory).

but i didn't realize how difficult it is to generate and evaluate new ideas, choose what to work on, and get a sense for what's important in a subtopic. i was lucky in my master's to have been given pretty approachable project that i was able to come up with tons of ideas for once i really spend some time getting into it. but i have much more difficulty with this now, and find it hard to have any confidence in ideas that i come up with, and struggle to navigate literature and get a sense for a new topic in an efficient manner.

i haven't published any conference papers in two years. i really have no idea how i'm going to propose a thesis soon. i spend the majority of my time working on projects that are either heavily applied without interesting ml components or really experiment-heavy scientific-type ""compare all these approaches for this task on this suite of datasets"" type work. i don't really enjoy working on these sorts of things, and feel like i'm not learning much from them either. the rest of my time i flail around on ideas that end up not working out or i lose confidence in them for a variety of reasons.

i don't enjoy research anymore. these days, i look forward to doing problem sets from courses because i find them more satisfying than research. before my phd, i enjoyed going to my desk and working on research most days, time would just disappear sometimes, and i thought about research all the time. nowadays, school makes me anxious. i feel a lot of pressure to fix my lack of progress. i don't care about being the best or anything, but i get jealous of other student's work. i wonder if i'm just not cut out for independent research (and my advisor wonders similarly).

**career/future uncertainties**

anyway, i used to think that i'd shoot for an industry research job at places like brain/fair/msr, etc when i graduate, but i know these jobs can be pretty competitive, and i'm not sure if this is realistic if i end up with a really mediocre phd. i feel like half of our departments ml phd admissions this year are already more successful than i am, and with the number of people i see trying to push into the field, i worry it’s not very realistic to expect to get some blue-sky research unicorn job. though i do see quite a few other students graduate to get faculty jobs, or hired into research labs.

when interning at big tech companies as an undergrad/masters student, i met several people with phd's in technical fields working in ordinary swe roles alongside other engineers. i've also met a couple people with ml-related phd's at these sorts of companies that spend most of their time with data cleaning/preprocessing. i've also heard from two software engineer friends (again, at “faang” type companies) in the past two years that \~*90% of the new graduate applicants they’ve interviewed recently indicate that they are interested in ml/data science positions.* they insisted that wasn’t an exaggerated figure. i’ve heard of data science job openings getting hundreds applicants, many of which have masters degrees from top cs schools and great grades/projects/resumes. on the other hand i've also seen posts on reddit claiming $300k+ salaries straight out of phd. does this happen?

i’ve been particularly worried recently of the idea of spending over a decade of my youth in higher education, sitting at a desk, not saving money, and end up with an ordinary software engineer or data engineer job in the end. a few years ago, i just cared about working on cool problems, and didn’t have much of a problem with that idea, but now that i’m 27 years old and no longer enjoying what i’m doing, i have a different perspective, and really feel the need to be building a future for myself.

**career/future goals**

ideally, i’d like to put myself in a position where i have deep experience/knowledge on a specific, useful, technical niche. i’d like to be “the guy who does x”. i’m not even set on having a research scientist career, as long as i get to do somewhat-creative work with technical/mathematical ideas in ml/stats/algos/or type topics. i’d also like to have a unique and in-demand enough skillset to be compensated well, and have a work-life balance if possible.

of course, anyone would like to have a great career, and that may not be so easy to achieve, but many people are in positions like that. i’d really like to avoid ending up in a hyper-competitive field that all of the smart young people aspire to go into, which i’m worried is what ml and data science are now. i’d also like to avoid being a nameless software engineer building data pipelines without much opportunity for creative work.

edit: i wrote this in a comment below ""i think my ideal job would be something like:

here's  this applied problem which for reasons xyz, there's no real  established, canonical method to apply to solve it. here's a nice clean  dataset. modify existing methods and stitch together some research  papers into a novel methodological solution for this specific case.""

i used to have a friend who runs a software consulting business who made great money, worked something like 12 hours a week most of the year, and traveled around the world kiteboarding. although he had to work pretty hard to get the business going initially, he was living this life at the age of 29. i have a close friend who’s attempting to build himself something similar right now (though he isn’t in tech), and the idea of trying to minimize work and maximize other parts of life is seeming more and more appealing to me as well.

**questions**

in summation, i’ve been feeling pretty lost and isolated in my current situation (though a lot of this likely has to do with spending months on end alone indoors due to the pandemic). my goal is still to try turn my phd around, and find a good direction that i can pull a few solid papers out of. but i’d really like to get a better sense of what my options will be in the future. so i want to ask:

1. what level of research background do i need to land ml research scientist industry positions? both more and less applied roles. are these open to phd graduates with just a handful of lower-impact, less-interesting, less-cited, but still sound papers?
2. what sorts of jobs do ml phd graduates have? what is the day-to-day work like?
3. **how should i go about planning for/setting myself up for the type of career i described?** is this even the right way to think about things? edit: this wasn't in reference to my consulting friend (though question 5 is), that's not really the sort of goal i have right now. this was in reference to the couple paragraphs preceding that.
4. how can i find out what sort of applications and topics are most relevant in industry? i'm aware of applications in cv and nlp and a couple other topics i've worked on, but most of the work i hear about comes from academic conferences, reading groups, faculty and students talks, etc. i don't really have a good sense for what happens in industry, and what's important to people there.
5. has anyone had success in this field with a remote low-time-commitment sort of job? or built a business that allowed you to do that? (more just out of curiosity)
6. what are your industry experiences in general working in more/less applied positions, research positions, engineering positions, etc.?

i'd appreciate any sort of advice/thoughts in general. thanks for reading this.",37,8569,6,1491

**update**: thanks to the users in the comments who suggested a temporary [developer-suggested fix](https://twitter.com/advadnoun/status/1364939598384623617) to reduce white blotches. to make this fix, change the line in ""latent coordinate"" that reads

    normu = torch.nn.functional.gumbel_softmax(self.normu.view(1, 8192, -1), dim=-1).view(1, 8192, 64, 64)

to

    normu = torch.nn.functional.gumbel_softmax(self.normu.view(1, 8192, -1), dim=-1, tau = 1.5).view(1, 8192, 64, 64)

by adding "", tau = 1.5"" (without quotes) after ""dim=-1"". the higher this parameter value is, apparently the lower the chance is of white blotches, but with the tradeoff of less sharpness. some people have suggested trying 1.2, 1.7, or 2 instead of 1.5.

now, i've got an opportunity to do a phd in operations research in a mid-range uk university, funded.  but, all i ever really interested in was ml/dl, and it was the sole reason that i wanted to do a phd. although, i am grateful and realize this is a good opportunity for me as someone coming from a developing country and, also, straight from my undergrad. 

i had limited exposure to the operations research field as i limited my scope to graph problems and i had focused more on the learning side of things. i can't really tell what operation research phd would entail except that i will work on the same topic of my research. also, i am a little hesitant as i fear some of the math topics that i had almost turned blind eye to would come back to bite me in the ass or i would get demotivated in the process and dropout.

is it a good expectation to do complete my phd, which is when i expect to be around my mid twenties, and then transition into ml research during post-doc and stuff? should i get an ml masters first then apply to ml phds? are there any big differences in the coursework? or, are they practically indistinguishable as both are essentially concerned in optimization?",59,1519,9,269

i would love any input or ideas!",82,829,13,116

instead, we have a million paper titled ***x is all you need*** that show some marginal effects when applying x. 

another frequent pattern of mediocre paper titles is to describe the method instead of the results. for instance, *reinforcement learning with bayesian kernel latent meanfield priors* (made up title). such titles are already better than the x is all you need crap, but describes what the authors are doing instead of what the authors showed/observed. for example, i prefer *bayesian kernel latent meanfield priors improve learning in hard-to-explore reinforcement learning environments.*

**output:** a full interactive graph of similar papers to explore.

for example, here is the [graph for efficientnet](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/4f2eda8077dc7a69bb2b4e0a1a086cf054adb3f9/efficientnet-rethinking-model-scaling-for-convolutional-neural-networks/graph):

since launch we've been positively overwhelmed with feedback from the scientific community and half a million researchers using the tool.

**today is a big milestone for us - we have partnered with** [**arxiv.org**](https://arxiv.org) **and from now on every paper page in arxiv will link to a corresponding connected papers graph.**

full title: every model learned by gradient descent is approximately a kernel machine

&#x200b;

deep neural networks are often said to discover useful representations of the data. however, this paper challenges this prevailing view and suggest that rather than representing the data, deep neural networks store superpositions of the training data in their weights and act as kernel machines at inference time. this is a theoretical paper with a main theorem and an understandable proof and the result leads to many interesting implications for the field.

errata: i simplify a bit too much when i pit kernel methods against gradient descent. of course, you can even learn kernel machines using gd, they're not mutually exclusive. and it's also not true that you ""don't need a model"" in kernel machines, as it usually still contains learned parameters.",77,1298,12,170

* data engineer by another name: spark/hadoop/glue, db & data warehouse stuff, etl etc.

* researcher plus: lots of experience in a specific area (typically dl, nlp, cv etc.), combined with some low-level skills in c/c++

* ml ops/ds+dev: ds background but focused on implementation & deployment - needs production-level code, plus skills in devops stuff (k8s/ci/cd tools/etc.) and/or backend stuff (e.g. redis, kafka, an aws or gcp cert)

* hardcore low-latency ninja: seen especially in financial services, really strong low-level skills in a c-family language or similar - presumably working on implementation of dl at the edge where speed is key

no two jobs are the same, of course, but most i have seen appear to fall into these broad categories.

what do you think? is this a fair assessment?

do you think an mle should be focused on specialising highly into one of these areas, or is a broad, flexible skill set equally useful?

1,[R][P] Talking Head Anime from a Single Image 2: More Expressive,1,218,41,1612218048,"[r][p] talking head anime from a single image 2: more expressive in 2019, i created a [network](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning/comments/e1k092/rp_talking_head_anime_from_a_single_image/) that can anime faces of anime characters. it takes a frontalized face image and a 6-dimensional vector that specify the pose (i.e. the *pose vector*), and it outputs another image of the character with the specified pose.

one of the main drawbacks of the network is its lack of expressiveness: not counting its ability to rotate faces, all it can do is closing eyes and mouths.

for the last one year or so, i have been working on a project to make the network more capable. the new version can manipulate 39 types of movements of facial features. (most of these are equivalent to ""[blend shapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morph_target_animation)"" in computer graphics lingo.) it can move the eyebrows and the irises and make several different eye and mouth shapes. characters can now make many different types of facial expressions.

[expressions generated by the network.](https://preview.redd.it/hgwelw9zsxe61.jpg?width=1055&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c6c2ca290e61c9c332c978aa18f53add9ffd7fa)

with the new network, i created three content creation tools:

1. [a new gui for detailed manipulation of anime facial expressions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=535mjojpy38)
2. [a new system for real-time performance as anime characters.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13mlxnwdfy)
3. a program that converts motions authored for 3d models so i can use it to drive characters images.

with the last tool, i created some music videos using downloadable 3d motions. here's one:

perhaps the more fun part of this project is to lip sync songs and then have some of my favorite characters sing them. here's my rendition of the internet famous ""dame da ne"" meme, created with the help of the second tool.

https://reddit.com/link/lafy8i/video/wtq834bbwxe61/player

this type of meme videos are typically created with the first order motion model of siarohin et al., but the model does not work well on anime characters and has a tendency to distort faces (to comedic effects). on the other hand, my network is specialized to anime characters, and you can see from the video that it preserves their beauty well.

1,[P] Deploying ML models on a budget,1,320,72,1612198117,"[p] deploying ml models on a budget over the years, i've done a lot of ml side-projects, all involving deploying ml models quickly and in a somewhat robust fashion. the goal is to get the model deployed **as cheaply as possible**, with **as low downtime** as possible. however, when trying various tech, i encountered various problems:

* **using cloud functions (gcp functions, aws lambda):** low memory (max 2-4gb), quick timeouts, costs scale with time.
* **kubernetes cluster:** managed cluster costs >$100, and add on top the cost for the resources used. also, my ops chops aren't good enough to manage a cluster on my own.
* **deploying bare-metal:** just using a bare-metal instance is probably the most straightforward, but even there the costs were hurting me. for example, for a simple 16 gb vm on google cloud platform costs $65/month. that might not be too much for many people, but for someone who does many side projects, it accumulates!

so i sat down and tried to create a solution that satisfies the low-cost requirement, and is easy and repeatable across projects. and lo and behold, i came up with my own approach: [budgetml](https://github.com/ebhy/budgetml).

budgetml lets you deploy your model on a [google cloud platform preemptible instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible) (which is **\~80% cheaper** than a regular instance) with a **secured https api** endpoint. the tool sets it up in a way that the instance **autostarts** when it shuts down (at least once every 24 hours) with **only a few minutes of downtime**. therefore, it ensures the cheapest possible api endpoint with the lowest possible downtime.

this solved my problem: sure, i get a few minutes of downtime every day, but that is nothing compared to the cost savings i'm getting (i can use the same 16gb vm on gcp that cost $65/month for only $20/month).

check it out on github: [https://github.com/ebhy/budgetml](https://github.com/ebhy/budgetml) . it's open-source (so its free) and (hopefully) developer-friendly. it is by no means meant to be used in a full-fledged production-ready setup. it is simply a means to get a server up and running **as fast as possible** with the **lowest costs possible**. what do you think - is it useful? i can't be the only one to have this particular intersection of requirements for my ml projects.",35,2325,7,363

1,[D] An Interesting but Weird Thought: Regular Expressions for Images?,1,48,19,1612133074,"[d] an interesting but weird thought: regular expressions for images? this is basically a crackpot idea so fully expected to get downvoted. 

we use regular expressions to match for specific expressions in large amounts of texts (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regular_expression). imagine if you could do this with images (or even videos!). the applications for this would be endless: from medical image analysis (look for a set of canonical features of early stage cancers in mri) to autonomous robotics (a robot that can find specific things/people). 

we've scratched the surface of this kind of thing with object detection cnns (fast r-cnn) or segmentation. but, these kind of systems can only look for specific objects they were trained for without any notion of how to *systematically compose* these objects together. the expressive power of regular expressions would enable insanely detailed queries with large varieties of compositions. 

the closest thing to this kind of thing would be openai's clip/dall-e, but we've seen that clip can struggle with some level of systematic compositionality (an example: https://twitter.com/peabody124/status/1346565268538089483). i'm not denying that dall-e/clip are not learning some kind of regular expression-like mechanism if we really look under the hood. maybe it is, but it could also not be because it wasnt trained that way. but here's a rough sketch of how you could train an explicit image regular expression system:

1. curate a dataset of images (should be domain specific i.e. medical images, but let's say imagenet since everyone uses that right now). 

2. it's easy to come up with the ""primitives"" for a textual regular expression (e.g. a-z/0-9, whitespace characters, etc) but what would the primitives for an image be? we'd have to learn that, so these primitives would be initialized randomly and then as the model sees images of the dataset it'd refine these primitives to be whichever primitives maximize the likelihood/energy of the dataset. 

3. how do we define a likelihood/energy on an image? there are three operations of regular expressions: concatenation, alteration, and kleene star. we'd have to do some kind of discrete search over the space of regular expressions to find a regular expression that can best reconstruct the image as much as possible. this can be done through some kind of reconstruction loss and/or adverserial loss (like gans) and/or contrastive loss (like simclr). the performance of the primitives is based on how well the best-fitting regular expression can construct the image. 

obviously, there are so many things that need to be figured out. how do you even represent the primitives, how do you make the search efficient enough to traverse enough expressions, would this thing be stable enough, how can we make the whole framework differentiable, etc etc.

i think we're working towards this kind of thing. stuff like stochastic image grammars (http://sci-hub.se/10.1561/0600000018), energy-based models (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-06.pdf), neuro-symbolic program synthesis (combining discrete search w/ continuous gradient-based optimization https://blog.sigplan.org/2020/04/15/synthesizing-neurosymbolic-programs/, https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12584) are all kind of within the same space and scratching at this possibility.

*----*

this week’s us rollout of the first covid-19 vaccine is a major milestone, a true triumph for scientists, and a massive relief for the rest of us. but it’s also an excuse to revisit my least favorite paper published this year.

that paper, “[estimating the deep replicability of scientific findings using human and artificial intelligence](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/uzzi/htm/papers/replicability-pnas-2020.pdf),” was written by a team of researchers at northwestern led by brian uzzi. it was published in pnas on may 4, and its publication was accompanied by a glowing press release (“[ai speeds up search for covid-19 treatments and vaccines](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/05/ai-tool-speeds-up-search-for-covid-19-treatments-and-vaccines/?fj=1)”) and received credulous coverage in outlets like [fortune](https://fortune.com/2020/05/04/artificial-intelligence-reproducibility-crisis-kellogg/) and [the wall street journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/northwestern-university-team-develops-tool-to-rate-covid-19-research-11589275800).

one of my primary professional interests is using data analysis to systematically identify good science, so i was eager to dig into the paper. unfortunately, i found that the paper is flawed and doesn’t support the covid-related story that the authors and northwestern shared with the media. my initial skepticism has proved out; vaccines are now being distributed with (as far as i can tell) no help whatsoever from this particular bit of ai. closer analysis will show that the paper isn’t convincing, that it had nothing to do with covid, and that the author was reckless in how he promoted it.

**problem #1: the machine learning in the academic paper is flawed**

the core of the paper is a machine learning model built by the authors that predicts whether or not a paper will replicate. to be technical about it, the model is trained on a dataset of 96 social science papers, 59 of which (61.4%) failed to replicate. the model takes the full text of the paper as an input, uses word embeddings and tf-idf to convert each text to a 400-dimensional vector, and then feeds those vectors into an ensemble logistic regression/random forest model. the cross-validated results show an average accuracy of 0.69 across runs compared to the baseline accuracy of 0.614. these are all standard techniques, but skilled machine learning practitioners are already raising their eyebrows about three points:

* **the authors don’t have enough data to build a reliable model**. the authors have used just 96 examples to build a model with 400 input variables. as mentioned above, the model has two components: a logistic regressor and a random forest. a conventional rule of thumb is that logistic regression requires a minimum of 10 examples per variable, which would suggest that the authors need 40x more data. “underdetermined” doesn’t even begin to describe the situation.  
the data needs of random forests are harder to characterize. while geneticists [routinely use random forests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3154091/) in settings with more variables than examples, their use case is typically more focused on determining variable importance than actually making predictions. and indeed, [some research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25532820/) that random forests need more than 200 examples per variable, or almost 1000x more data than the authors have.  
**the bottom line is that you can’t build a reliable machine learning model on just 96 papers.**
* **the model structure is too complicated**. model structure is the garden of forking paths for machine learning. adjustments to a model can improve its performance on available data while reducing performance on unseen data. (and no, cross-validation alone doesn’t fix this!) the model structure the authors describe is reasonable enough, but it also includes some clearly arbitrary choices like using both logistic regression and random forests (rather than just picking one) or aggregating word vectors using both simple averaging and tf-idf (again rather than just picking one.) with just 96 examples in the dataset, each version of model that the authors tried had a real chance to show a cross-validation accuracy that looked like success despite arising from chance. in context, **trying multiple model architectures is the the equivalent of performing subgroup analyses.**
* **the effect size is too small.** increasing accuracy from the baseline of 0.614 to 0.69 is simply not that significant, particularly in light of the small sample size and the large number of degrees of freedom in model design. the paper’s statistical analyses generate pleasing p-values (*p<0.001*) demonstrating that the model is effective *on this particular set of papers.* but what we’re actually interested in is whether the model outperforms the baseline on unseen data (i.e. whether it has better generalization error.)  
performing [inference about generalization error](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/a:1024068626366) is a [challenging task](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790639) (and there isn’t a single agreed upon methodology), but for our purposes a simple t-test will do. the cynical baseline (predicting that nothing ever replicates) gives an accuracy of 0.614 on these 96 papers. the authors’ model achieves an accuracy of 0.69 on those same papers. that gives a one-tailed p-value of 0.134 — a delightful value for a paper that is itself about replicability.  
and indeed, the cynical baseline really does outperform the model on at least one dataset! eyeballing figure 3 of the paper, i see that the model achieves about 0.65 accuracy on test set 1. but 7 out of the 8 results in that set failed to replicate, so **our cynical baseline achieves an accuracy of 0.875 — outperforming the “ai” model by more than 20 percentage points.**

let me be very clear: these are very fundamental problems. after reviewing the paper, i’m not confident that their machine learning model adds any value at all. it reflects poorly on pnas that this paper made it through peer review. unfortunately, general scientific journals - no matter how prestigious - don’t seem equipped to effectively review papers involving machine learning; nature’s infamous paper on predicting earthquakes with deep learning was [widely criticized](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning/comments/c4ylga/d_misuse_of_deep_learning_in_nature_journals/) in the machine learning community.

**problem #2: the paper has nothing to do with covid**

let’s set aside every issue i’ve raised to this point and accept that the authors really can identify social science papers that are less likely to replicate. that still doesn’t make it relevant to covid.

their entire system is premised on picking up subtle linguistic markers that supposedly indicate when a researcher (perhaps subconsciously) believes she’s performing sub-par science. uzzi compares the approach to reading body language.

but there’s no reason to believe that the linguistic “body language” of psychologists tells us anything about the body language of covid-19 researchers. psychology and virology are very different fields with different conventions even in normal times. the pandemic itself has undoubtedly impacted word choices, as papers written under extreme time pressure by researchers from around the world get shared to pre-print servers rather than being polished and published in journals. at a minimum, the model would have to be significantly adjusted to be applied to covid research.

**problem #3: northwestern and brian uzzi crossed the line promoting this paper**

self-promotion is a natural and even important part of science; good research doesn’t always get the attention is deserves. and certainly the decade-long ai boom has been driven forward by rosy projections about what ai can accomplish. but the paper’s lead author, brian uzzi, went too far in his efforts to promote it.

the paper was published just two months into the pandemic at a time when the trauma felt more acute than chronic. the uncertainty and fear fueled a desperation for anything that might end the ordeal. in that environment, putting out a press release entitled “ai speeds up search for covid-19 treatments and vaccines” takes on a moral dimension.

the scientists and trial participants who brought us a vaccine in record time are heroes. meanwhile, the wall street journal coverage of this paper now has a correction appended:

>northwestern university researchers will make an artificial-intelligence tool designed to rate the promise of scientific papers on covid-19 vaccines and treatments available when testing is completed. an earlier version of this article incorrectly said the tool would be available later this year.

indeed.

### about google's approach to research publication

i understand the concern over timnit gebru’s resignation from google.  she’s done a great deal to move the field forward with her research.  i wanted to share the email i sent to google research and some thoughts on our research process.

here’s the email i sent to the google research team on dec. 3, 2020:

\[already posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning/comments/k6467v/n_the_email_that_got_ethical_ai_researcher_timnit/)\]

i’ve also received questions about our research and review process, so i wanted to share more here.  i'm going to be talking with our research teams, especially those on the ethical ai team and our many other teams focused on responsible ai, so they know that we strongly support these important streams of research.  and to be clear, we are deeply committed to continuing our research on topics that are of particular importance to individual and intellectual diversity  -- from unfair social and technical bias in ml models, to the paucity of representative training data, to involving social context in ai systems.  that work is critical and i want our research programs to deliver more work on these topics -- not less.

in my email above, i detailed some of what happened with this particular paper.  but let me give a better sense of the overall research review process.  it’s more than just a single approver or immediate research peers; it’s a process where we engage a wide range of researchers, social scientists, ethicists, policy & privacy advisors, and human rights specialists from across research and google overall.  these reviewers ensure that, for example, the research we publish paints a full enough picture and takes into account the latest relevant research we’re aware of, and of course that it adheres to our [ai principles](https://ai.google/principles).

those research review processes have helped improve many of our publications and research applications. while more than 1,000 projects each year turn into published papers, there are also many that don’t end up in a publication.  that’s okay, and we can still carry forward constructive parts of a project to inform future work.  there are many ways we share our research; e.g. publishing a paper, open-sourcing code or models or data or colabs, creating demos, working directly on products, etc. 

this paper surveyed valid concerns with large language models, and in fact many teams at google are actively working on these issues. we’re engaging the authors to ensure their input informs the work we’re doing, and i’m confident it will have a positive impact on many of our research and product efforts.

but the paper itself had some important gaps that prevented us from being comfortable putting google affiliation on it.  for example, it didn’t include important findings on how models can be made more efficient and actually reduce overall environmental impact, and it didn’t take into account some recent work at google and elsewhere on mitigating bias in language models.   highlighting risks without pointing out methods for researchers and developers to understand and mitigate those risks misses the mark on helping with these problems.  as always, feedback on paper drafts generally makes them stronger when they ultimately appear.

we have a strong track record of publishing work that challenges the status quo -- for example, we’ve had more than 200 publications focused on responsible ai development in the last year alone.  just a few examples of research we’re engaged in that tackles challenging issues:

* [measuring and reducing gendered correlations in pre-trained nlp models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06032)
* [evading deepfake-image detectors with white- and black-box attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00622)

i’m proud of the way google research provides the flexibility and resources to explore many avenues of research.  sometimes those avenues run perpendicular to one another.  this is by design.  the exchange of diverse perspectives, even contradictory ones, is good for science and good for society.  it’s also good for google.  that exchange has enabled us not only to tackle ambitious problems, but to do so responsibly.

our aim is to rival peer-reviewed journals in terms of the rigor and thoughtfulness in how we review research before publication.  to give a sense of that rigor, this blog post captures some of the detail in one facet of review, which is when a research topic has broad societal implications and requires particular ai principles review -- though it isn’t the full story of how we evaluate all of our research, it gives a sense of the detail involved: [https://blog.google/technology/ai/update-work-ai-responsible-innovation/](https://blog.google/technology/ai/update-work-ai-responsible-innovation/)

we’re actively working on improving our paper review processes, because we know that too many checks and balances can become cumbersome.  we will always prioritize ensuring our research is responsible and high-quality, but we’re working to make the process as streamlined as we can so it’s more of a pleasure doing research here.

a final, important note -- we evaluate the substance of research separately from who’s doing it.  but to ensure our research reflects a fuller breadth of global experiences and perspectives in the first place, we’re also committed to making sure google research is a place where every googler can do their best work.  we’re pushing hard on our efforts to improve representation and inclusiveness across google research, because we know this will lead to better research and a better experience for everyone here.",66,7096,9,968

1,"[Discussion] Curious cases of evaluation metrics - ""Macro F1"" score",1,54,27,1605693156,"[discussion] curious cases of evaluation metrics - ""macro f1"" score hi,

i recently read the paper ""macro f1 and macro f1"" [1] (at first i thought there was a typo in the title, but it's not a typo), where they show that two different variants of the ""macro f1"" metric have been used to evaluate classifiers. apparently, they can lead to considerable differences in scores.

one variant is the one implemented in scikit-learn: [*average over f1 score per class*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html). i guess it is today more frequently used.

the other variant has been also used lots of times, and can be found, e.g., in this well-cited paper [1], that has over 3k citations (*compute recall and precision average over classes and then do the harmonic mean*).

i think a main problem is that researchers have little space in papers so they presumably cannot display the metric formulas. e.g., if they just say ""we use macro f1"" in their paper without displaying a formula, i guess that follow-up researchers may accidentally use a different formula and i guess this could render any comparison as essentially useless...

what's your opinion on all of this? or, more specifically, **have you heard about similar cases of confusion in evaluation, or do you know about other curious facets of evaluation metrics?**

1,[D] I keep running across studies designed this way,1,100,45,1605573371,"[d] i keep running across studies designed this way looking for some clarity [on this study methodology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56185-5). n = 100. number of features = 3072. correlated features are removed to leave 927. then they use a form of supervised feature ranking and sequential feature selection to find the ""optimal"" feature set. finally, they perform leave-one-out cross validation to determine performance metrics (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity).

what i don't understand is how you can start with a ton of features, throw a bunch away, use a classifier to pick the ""best"" feature set, and then do leave-one-out cross validation. hasn't every held out sample in the cross validation already contributed to supervising feature selection? couldn't you just use this method on a matrix of random data and end up with better than chance predictions? is there something i'm missing?

1,[P] How GPT3 Works - Visuals and Animations,1,62,33,1595576538,"[p] how gpt3 works - visuals and animations hi r/machinelearning,

i have written a thread on twitter containing multiple animations to explain the high-level picture of how language models like gpt3 work.

[https://twitter.com/jayalammar/status/1285498971960598529](https://twitter.com/jayalammar/status/1285498971960598529)

in a way, it's kind of a machine learning intro as it touches on what the usual training process is like. it's raw and i published the figures rapidly as i created them -- a departure from my previous posts where i'd take a few weeks. that's because i am dedicating a lot more of my time towards ml now and because i had a lot of the content and visual language already figured out from [illustrated gpt2](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/).

i have  a couple of questions that i'm hoping someone in the community can help me with:

1- did you see an indication of the dimension of word embeddings gpt3 uses? extrapolating from how gpt2 and transformers are set up, i'm lead to believe that it uses 12,288 dimensions for the embeddings. but come on, that's frighteningly large. what then could it be?

&#x200b;

2- what is the model doing to support few-shot learning? is it simply adding the examples to the input prompt? intuitively i'd assume it would probably assign higher attention weights to the examples. i am ignorant about few-shot learning and how it's implemented in transformer models. any guidance or resources would be highly appreciated.",43,1451,8,215
1,[D] The cost of training GPT-3,1,103,61,1595510509,"[d] the cost of training gpt-3 there are two sources that estimate the cost of training gpt-3 at [$12 million](https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/openai-launches-an-api-to-commercialize-its-research/) and [$4.6 million](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3/). and i am a bit confused about how they got those numbers.

the used microsoft azure cloud offers, via infiniband connectable, [8xv100 machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/) at $10.7957/hour (1 year reserved), which translates to around $260 per day.

in the paper there is a sentence saying that they used half-precision and loss-scaling for training. one v100 can deliver up to [120 teraflop/s](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html) using float16. per machine (8xv100), this translates to 960 teraflop/s in theory.  let's assume in practice we can utilize our compute resources at \~50%, which gives us around 500 teraflop/s per machine.

as we know from the paper it takes 3640 petaflop/s-days to train the largest 175b model, which translates to a training run of 7280 days (or \~20 years) on a single 8xv100 machine. in terms of cost, this would be **$1.9 million**. 

let's say we don't want to wait 20 years, so if we connect 64 of such 8xv100 machines we can reduce the training time to around 4 months (costs might go up due to reduced compute efficiency of the multi-node communication).

my question is, is the calculation above roughly accurate (azure hourly costs, assumed compute utilization)?

after reading all the implementation details and optimization of the paper, i also began to think about development costs. setting up a fast training pipeline to utilize the compute resources efficiently is not trivial given the size of the model and the resulting need to model parallelism.",30,1832,6,249

1,[D] Consumer GPU cloud rental (vast.ai),1,115,68,1595323188,"[d] consumer gpu cloud rental (vast.ai) i've been using [vast.ai](https://vast.ai/console/create/) these past two weeks while i've been on holiday, and i'm really impressed. aside from being really cheap - 20c/hour for an rtx 2080 ti on-demand, 10c for interruptable - it's also really simple. topping up your account is one click, renting a gpu is one click, and the interface compresses an awful lot of information into a small space.

it's not particularly common knowledge, but the fundamental advantage of these kinds of distributed gpu rental services is that [nvidia forbids its consumer gpus from being used in datacenters](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nvidia-updates-geforce-eula-to-prohibit-data-center-use/), even though they have much the same abilities as their far more expensive datacenter versions. this is why you never see rtx 2080s on aws or azure.

## issues
so far my only qualms have been
* you can't filter by compute capability, which means some amount of looking gpus up on wikipedia
* i can't find a way to use private docker images 
* **it's hosted on some stranger's machine**. for working on [megastep](http://andyljones.com/megastep/) that's not been a problem since it's open source, but there's more sensitive stuff i'd be reluctant to use it for. 
  * only impact for the megastep work is i've been sure to use agent forwarding rather than copying my keys around.
  * below, /u/psychogenicamoebae points out that while agent forwarding protects the key, the host user can still access the forwarding port and use it to impersonate you. a fix for this is to create a disposable keypair to use on the remote machine instead.

## workflow
my workflow has been to copy the ssh details into my `~/.ssh/config`, a la
```
host vast
   hostname ssh4.vast.ai
   user root
   port 14567
   identityfile ~/.ssh/vast_rsa
   forwardagent yes
```
and then use [vscode's superb remote support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) to do all my development remotely. 
```
code --folder-uri ""vscode-remote://ssh-remote+vast/root""
```
one thing i haven't settled on is whether to use the built-in notebook support or to use a separate jupyter instance and have vscode forward a port to it. vscode's notebook support is a little easier to work with, but i have accumulated a mass of notebook plugins that i'm loathe to give up.

## alternatives 
the next alternative on my list to try out is [fluidstack](https://www.fluidstack.io/). they use unoccupied gaming center pcs, which has the advantage of having *slightly* better security (?) and better internet connections. only thing that's stopped me using them so far is the lack of cheap linux machines.

## disclaimer
this might all come off a bit hailcorporate, so to be clear: i have no association with vast.ai. i just think it deserves to be more widely known, especially by independent researchers.

## other people's experiences

/u/mimsyy
> my main issue with vast.ai is that while you can have a persistent disk, you're most likely not going to get your gpu back if you turn it off (at least not in my experience). so if you're working on a project with a long setup time (e.g. downloading/preprocessing a lot of data), you're kind of forced to keep your instance running 100% of the time while experimenting unless you're able to prototype on your local machine.
>
> that said, vast.ai is of course super convenient if you are able to develop for the most part on your local machine and your project has a short setup time, so that you can just quickly spin up an instance when you need it.
>
> other than that, i've found it a bit less reliable than aws/gcp, with some instances having poor latency, randomly shutting down, and also just randomly being removed entirely.

/u/5death2moderation
> they are really bad in my experience. they list the up/down speeds on containers not relative to you, but from their actual geographic location. so sure, a really fast upload speed may be nice, but if the server is in russia it really doesn't mean shit. they also charge you for the time it takes to determine if the container has actual viable network connections and support told me ""just spin up like 10 instances and drop the ones that don't work"" as if that isn't awful advice. i also have had container connections die on me like 5 or 6 times so if you are going to use it do not skip using tmux.

/u/killver
> i occasionally use vast.ai but they have huge issue that make them partly unusable for me. for example for nearly all machines you share cpu and ram with others, so if someone else spams the cores you have a super hard time running anything. also data transfer is extremely expensive, i have no idea why. extending data disk is impossible, and so on.

using custom layers with the functional api results in missing weights in the `trainable_variables`. those weights are not in the `non_trainable_variables` either. 

but if those weights aren't in `trainable_variables`they are essential frozen, since it is only those weights that receive gradient updates, as seen in the keras model training code below:

this gist uses the transformers library to create the models so its easy to see the bug. for an in-depth look, the colab gist below creates all the custom layers from scratch

as you can see in the notebooks, a workaround is to create models using keras subclassing instead; model subclassing results in all the weights appearing in `trainable_variables`. to be absolutely sure that the functional api and subclasses models are exactly the same, i ran inference on them using the same input at the bottom of each notebook; the outputs for the models were exactly the same. but training using the functional api model would treat many of the weights as frozen (and there's no way to make them unfrozen since those weights aren't registered in the `non_trainable_variables` either). 

i've been looking at this for about a month, as far as i can tell, i don't think there was anything unique about the transformer layer i created; it may be the case that any keras model using custom sublayers and the functional api is prone to this. 

i put up a github issue 24 days ago, but i can't tell if this is something being worked on.

hi all, i am new to the field and trying to figure the best place for me in the job world is. i have a bachelor's in cs and a master's in biology. i did not do any machine learning in my bachelor's but did do some in my master's, but mostly it was descriptive statistics. i really don't understand the differences between jobs titled 'data scientist', 'machine learning', and 'ai/dl engineer'? i know some machine learning concepts, some deep learning, and some statistics, but i wouldn't say i know any of them that well. before i went for my master's in bio i was a software engineer.

i am wondering what the differences are between the roles, and what skills are emphasized in one over the other? i would say i really like making plots, and enjoy theory and math, but i don't like working on things directly related to sales/marketing or sitting in a bunch of meetings. i know i am being picky :) but any clarification over the different roles and/or recommendations on what to focus on would be appreciated, thanks

1,[D] The machine learning community has a toxicity problem,1,95,653,1593547579,"[d] the machine learning community has a toxicity problem it is omnipresent!

**first** of all, the peer-review process is *broken*. every fourth neurips submission is put on arxiv. there are deepmind researchers publicly going after reviewers who are criticizing their iclr submission. on top of that, papers by well-known institutes that were put on arxiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection. in contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the ac. (i don't want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this year's icrl).

**secondly,** there is a *reproducibility crisis*. tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. as a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.

**thirdly,** there is a *worshiping* problem. every paper with a stanford or deepmind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. for instance, bert has seven times more citations than ulmfit. the google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. at every icml conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every deepmind poster, regardless of the content of the work. the same story happened with the zoom meetings at the virtual iclr 2020. moreover, neurips 2020 had twice as many submissions as icml, even though both are top-tier ml conferences. why? why is the name ""neural"" praised so much? next, bengio, hinton, and lecun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the ""godfathers"" of ai is insane. it has reached the level of a cult.

**fourthly**, the way yann lecun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. however, the *toxicity* and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity. getting rid of lecun and silencing people won't solve any issue.

**fifthly**, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge *diversity problem*. at our cs faculty, only 30% of undergrads and 15% of the professors are women. going on parental leave during a phd or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career. however, this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism.  reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. people are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.

**sixthly**, moral and ethics are set *arbitrarily*. the u.s. domestic politics dominate every discussion. at this very moment, thousands of uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. adding a ""broader impact"" section at the end of every people will not make this stop. there are huge shitstorms because a researcher wasn't mentioned in an article. meanwhile, the 1-billion+ people continent of africa is virtually excluded from any meaningful ml discussion (besides a few indaba workshops).

**seventhly**, there is a cut-throat publish-or-perish *mentality*. if you don't publish 5+ neurips/icml papers per year, you are a looser. research groups have become so large that the pi does not even know the name of every phd student anymore. certain people submit 50+ papers per year to neurips. the sole purpose of writing a paper has become to having one more neurips paper in your cv. quality is secondary; passing the peer-preview stage has become the primary objective.

**finally**, discussions have become *disrespectful*. schmidhuber calls hinton a thief, gebru calls lecun a white supremacist, anandkumar calls marcus a sexist, everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved.

albert einstein was opposing the theory of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert_einstein#einstein's_objections_to_quantum_mechanics). can we please stop demonizing those who do not share our exact views. we are allowed to disagree without going for the jugular.

1,[D][R] A letter urging Springer Nature not to publish “A Deep Neural Network Model to Predict Criminality Using Image Processing”,1,46,507,1592933475,"[d][r] a letter urging springer nature not to publish “a deep neural network model to predict criminality using image processing” i know people on this sub have likely had their fill of fairness and bias related discussions the past few days, but i feel compelled to point out a letter (and associated petition) to the editors of springer nature asking them not to publish a paper purporting to identify likely criminals from images of faces.

&nbsp;

https://medium.com/@coalitionforcriticaltechnology/abolish-the-techtoprisonpipeline-9b5b14366b16

&nbsp;

nevermind that this type of research direction has been demonstrated to be fatally flawed in the past. the fact that this work is being legitimized with a peer reviewed stamp of approval makes me wonder when the first ml phrenology paper will surface.

&nbsp;

i think the important takeaway is understanding the differing definitions of bias. the letter makes it clear that the authors claim to “predict if someone is a criminal based solely on a picture of their face,” with “80 percent accuracy and with no racial bias.” the problem being that by using the phrase “no racial bias” they are conflating the issue of algorithmic bias with the societal notion of bias. the letter spells out the societal aspect quite well:

> let’s be clear: there is no way to develop a system that can predict or identify “criminality” that is not racially biased — because the category of “criminality” itself is racially biased.

&nbsp;

maybe we have a terminology issue that we as an ml community need to address so we can better convey the distinction between algorithmic bias (which may or may not be desirable depending on the desired result) versus the societal notion of bias, which can be codified in the datasets we use.

&nbsp;

anyway, despite the length of the letter, i think it’s an important read as it clearly elucidates a number of the issues that have been discussed around fairness in ml. i also urge people to sign the petition and email springer nature your concerns if you feel so inclined.

&nbsp;

edit: looks like the petition worked pretty quickly. springer nature isn’t going to publish the paper, though i would still urge people to read the linked letter (and the excellent footnotes) and potentially still show solidarity by signing the petition.

connected papers enables the researcher/engineer to explore paper-space in a much more efficient way. given one paper that you think is relevant to your problem, it generates a visual graph of related papers in a way that makes it easy to see the most cited / recent / similar papers at a glance (take a look at this [example graph](http://beta.connectedpapers.com:8050/main/9397e7acd062245d37350f5c05faf56e9cfae0d6/deepfruits-a-fruit-detection-system-using-deep-neural-networks/graph) for a paper called ""deepfruits: a fruit detection system using deep neural networks"").

1,[D] Antipatterns in open sourced ML research code,1,256,136,1586968981,"[d] antipatterns in open sourced ml research code hi all. i feel given the topic i have to put out a disclaimer first: i salute all the brave souls trying to get papers out in a phd environment and then having the courage to open source that code. i have adapted code from a number of such repositories both for my own education/personal projects as well as in production code. you are all amazing and have my deepest respects.

also your code has issues \*\*runs for cover\*\*

here's my notes on 5 antipatterns that i have encountered a lot. if you have more to add to the list kindly comment below. if you disagree with any of these let's start a discussion around it.

thanks.


when writing ml related research code (or any code for that matter) please try to avoid... 

1. make a monolithic config object that you keep passing through all your functions. configuration files are good, but if you load them into a dictionary and start mutating them everywhere they turn into a nightmare. (useful to mention
that doing this at the top level is usually not problematic, and can tie to your
cli as well) 

2. use argparse, sure, but don't use it like 1. also let's abolish the ""from args import get_args(); cfg = get_args()"" pattern. there's more straight forward ways to parse arguments from the commandline (e.g. if you use argh it'll naturally get you to structure your code around reusable functions)


3. please don't let your cli interface leak into your implementation details ... make a library first, and then expose it as a cli. this also makes everything a lot more reusable. 

4. unless there's a good reason to do so (hint, there very rarely is), don't use
files as intra-process-communication. if you are calling a function which saves a file which you then load in the next line of code, something has gone very 
wrong. if this function is from a different repo, consider cloning it, fixing, and then pring back and use the modified form. side effects have side effects and at some point they are going to cause a silent bug which is very likely to delay 
your research.

5. in almost all but the most trivial situations (or when you really need to do inference in batches for some reason), making a function that operates on an list of things is worse than making a function that operates on a single item. the latter is a lot more easier to use, compose with other functions, make parallel, etc. if you really end up needing an interface that accepts a list, you can just make a new function that calls the individual function.

edit: this point caused some confusion. there's always tradeoffs for performance. that's why batched inference/training exists. what i'm trying to point to is more when you have some function x that takes some noticeable amount of time y to operate on a single item, and it simply runs on this list of items one by one. in these cases, having the interface accept a list rather than a single item is adding unnecessary inflexibility for no gain in performance or expressibility.",49,2976,8,517

* [http://docs.bentoml.org/](http://docs.bentoml.org/)
* [https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml)

&#x200b;

# what does bentoml do?

* turn your ml model into production api endpoint with just a few lines of code
* support all major machine learning training frameworks
* high-performance api serving system with adaptive micro-batching support
* devops best practices baked in, simplify the transition from model development to production
* model management for teams, providing cli and web ui dashboard
* flexible model deployment orchestration with support for aws lambda, sagemaker, ec2, docker, kubernetes, knative and more

&#x200b;

# why bentoml?

shipping ml models to production is broken. data scientists may not have all the expertise in building production services and the trained models they delivered are very hard to test and deploy. this often leads to a time consuming and error-prone workflow, where a pickled model or weights file is handed over to a software engineering team.

bentoml is an end-to-end solution for model serving, making it possible for data science teams to ship their models as prediction services, in a way that is easy to test, easy to deploy, and easy to integrate with other devops tools.

&#x200b;

# how does it compare to [tensorflow-serving](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving)?

* both tensorflow-serving and bentoml provides support for adaptive micro-batching, related benchmarks can be found here [https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/tree/master/benchmark](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/tree/master/benchmark)
* tensorflow-serving only supports tensorflow framework at the moment, while bentoml has multi-framework support, works with tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, xgboost, fastai, and more;
* tensorflow loads the model in tf.savedmodel format, so all the graphs and computations must be compiled into the savedmodel. bentoml keeps the python runtime in serving time, making it possible to do pre-processing and post-processing in serving endpoints.

# how does it compare to [clipper](http://clipper.ai/)?

* bentoml provides micro-batching at the instance level while clipper does it at a cluster level. users can deploy bentoml api server containers in a more flexible way, while clipper requires all prediction requests being routed to its master node.
* bentoml is an end-to-end model serving solution. besides model serving, it also provides model packaging, model management, and deployment automation features. clipper focuses on the serving system.
* users can use bentoml with clipper, and deploy bentoml packaged models to their clipper cluster and benefit from both frameworks: [https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/deployment/clipper.html](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/deployment/clipper.html)

# how does it compare to aws sagemaker?

* when not using the build-in algorithms, model deployment on sagemaker requires users to build their own container image and api server
* bentoml provides a high-performance api server for its users without the need to work with lower-level web server development work
* bentoml packaged model can be easily deployed to sagemaker serving: [https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/deployment/aws\_sagemaker.html](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/deployment/aws_sagemaker.html)",71,3415,9,417

a tiny autograd engine. implements backpropagation over a dynamically built dag and a small neural networks library on top of it with a pytorch-like api. both are currently about 50 lines of code each.

the amusing part is that the dag only allows individual scalar values, so e.g. we chop up each neuron into all of its individual tiny adds and multiplies. in particular, the current library only supports scalars and three operations over them: `(+,*,relu)`, but these are actually enough to build up an entire deep neural net doing binary classification as the demo notebook shows. it's just a lot of nodes :)

potentially useful for educational purposes. see the notebook in the [repo](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) for demo.

i am thinking of applying for phd programs starting fall 2021. i want to do phd as i find nlp interesting, important and challenging field. i like working on challenging problems and trying to come up with new and better ways to solve them, but i am a bit disillusioned with the current research practices prevalent in nlp and i am rethinking my decision of doing a phd. 

many people have said this so i don't want to elaborate, but i really don't like how most of the nlp research involves poorly designed artificial datasets, leaderboards, sota chasing, neural networks stacking, lack of statistically significant results, lack of generalisation, overfitting to a particular dataset, being more engineering than science, etc.

from what i understand, phd takes a lot of effort. i am not ok with spending the prime of my youth, working overtime at reduced pay tweaking neural network architectures. i want to do interesting work. is it possible to do phd in nlp without just building new neural network architectures? i am in confusion about this as a most of the papers from even big groups follow such practices, and not doing so leaves only a few areas to work on, like interpretability, fairness, bias and finding issues in existing models, etc which are already crowded.    

would it be better to take up an applied nlp job at some company? at least i will be earning good money and working normal hours. and whatever neural network lego stacking i do, will go to production and improve some metric important for the company. am i right thinking like this? what are your thoughts?",80,2028,14,355

* where are the opportunities using machine learning?
* what efforts will be required on your team’s part to make it succeed?
* how much is a machine learning project going to cost you?
* how to recognize good ml engineers?

# technical considerations

**the tl/dr version**

* rule of thumb – if a human looking at data and can’t recognize a pattern, ml probably won’t also
* two type of algorithms – requires training or pre-trained
* unsupervised or anomaly detection algorithms rarely work, unless you have very clean data
* on the other hand, there are simple implementations for group separation for labeled groups
* the more training data the better, the minimal amount of data varies with project requirements and algorithms implemented
* data formatting, examination and transformation is roughly 70% of the work
* deep learning won’t solve your problems, unless maybe if you do vision\\signal processing
* killer feature is more important than the algorithm

# timelines, pricing and recruiting considerations

initial data examination takes a minimum of 1 hour for the simplest of cases to two weeks of full-time work.

time it takes to research specific algorithms or new algorithms released from academia:

1. at least 4 days to go over the most relevant research papers and information.
2. between half a day to 2 weeks to implement basic open source code, if it exists.
3. customizing the algorithms or training on your data might take months, depending on the complexity of the problem at hand, the quality of the training data (or, lack of it) and required kpis.

in some cases, such as anomaly detection, it is impossible to define actionable technical kpis because it is never clear how accurate even the best algorithm might turn out.

custom made projects can be expensive, prices range from 120$ to 300$ per hour work.

usually starting off small, with quick simple wins and then progressing if you see the value in implementing machine learning is the way to go. it is advisable not to spend months developing before you see any progress. try 1-2 months, focus on an achievable short-term goal, maybe even a simple report, with simple tools. if this works out, then advance to something more sophisticated.

1,[D] Normalized Convolution,1,171,33,1586799259,"[d] normalized convolution last year, buried within the stylegan2 paper ( [https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958) section 2.2 ) was an interesting implementation of what they called weight demodulation for convolutions. it was a standard convolution but where the kernel weights were modified by a number of different things specific to stylegan2 (conditional adain transformations, etc) before the operation was conducted. one of these modifications was that the kernel was normalized resulting in no change to the variance of the outputs relative to the inputs and this entirely removed the need for other normalization techniques like batch normalization.

i've stripped out all the stylegan2 specific stuff and implemented a simple normalized convolution layer for tf2 as a drop in replacement for standard convolutions here (not all default features/arguments implemented):

[https://github.com/tpapp157/contrastive\_multiview\_coding-momentum](https://github.com/tpapp157/contrastive_multiview_coding-momentum)

i've been experimenting with it pretty regularly over the last several months with good results. simply replace all standard convolutions with the normalized variant and remove any other sort of normalization layers (batch normalization, etc) you have in your network and that's all. as a simple test, a large network that fails to train without normalization of any kind trains just fine with normalized convolutions.

the big advantage this has over typical normalization is that batch statistics can be quite noisy. by incorporating the normalization into the kernel weights, the network effectively needs to learn the statistics of the entire dataset resulting in better and more consistent normalization. this also has the advantage of not requiring any weird workarounds for multi-gpu training like batch normalization does.

i haven't seen this talked about at all since that paper was released and i wanted to raise awareness since (at least from my limited experimentation) this seems like just an all around better way to approach normalization.",26,2075,3,282

i strongly believe that the point of conducting research of any form is to contribute to the greater body of knowledge and ultimately benefit the human race and the world we live in. not making your code public is, in my opinion, a hindrance to this progression and should be discouraged.

i've heard arguments along the lines of ""but what if i want to patent the code and make a living?"" the solution's simple: don't write a research paper and just build the project and file for the patent. i've also heard arguments along the lines of ""but what if someone steals my idea?"" i thought this is one of the uses of preprint platforms like arxiv?

honestly though, i'm a bit baffled at how reviewers would let papers through if the code isn't public in the first place. isn't a part of the review process for any scientific field to make sure the results are reproducible? i don't see how you'd test that unless the code's made public and you can run it.",94,1160,17,213

**code**: [available on github](https://github.com/fancompute/wavetorch)

lately, there has been a lot of cross-pollination of ideas between different areas of physical and numerical science and the field of machine learning. this has lead to interesting demonstrations of optimizing physical models using machine learning frameworks, but also to the development of a number of exciting new machine learning models (e.g. neural odes, hamiltonian neural networks, etc) that borrow concepts from physics.

my group has been particularly interested in the view point that physics itself can be used as a computational engine. in other words, we're interested in physical systems that can serve as hardware accelerators or as specialized analog processors for fast and efficient machine learning computations.

in our paper that was recently [published in science advances](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/12/eaay6946) (open access) we have shown that the physics of waves map directly into the time dynamics of recurrent neural networks (rnns). using this connection, we demonstrated that an acoustic / optical system (through a numerical model developed in pytorch) could be trained to accurately classify vowels from recordings of human speakers. essentially, we launched the vowel waveforms into the physical model and allowed the optimizer to add and remove material at 1000's of individual points within the domain, essentially acting as the weights of the model.

because this machine learning model actually corresponds to a physical system, it means that we could take the trained material distribution and ""print it"" into a real physical device. the result would be something like an asic (application specific integrated circuit), but for a specific rnn computation. we're really excited about these results because they point to being able to perform complex recurrent machine learning calculations **completely passively**, with no energy consumption, aside from the energy carried by the pulse itself.",78,2122,12,292

as someone who hasn't had much experience in rl, i see potential applications but am unsure of the amount of work or practicality of it. for example, one potential application for rl is to learn fraudulent behavior in an online retailer system (i.e. amazon, ebay) and proactively find methods of fraud before they happen. one could imagine all the unintended behavior of misspecified reward function being useful for finding exploits in a system ( [https://openai.com/blog/faulty-reward-functions/](https://openai.com/blog/faulty-reward-functions/)). but there are a lot of issues to overcome, (some mentioned in this article [https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html](https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html)) about sample inefficiency, not to mention having to build your own simulator (and hope it's representative to some degree).

what are people's opinion on the practicality of using rl in something like fraud? does it even make sense to build a simple online retailer simulator? i ask because it while i think rl is quite powerful, it feels it isn't quite ready to be used. i would love to be shown to be wrong.",40,1434,5,208

1,[D] DeepMind's PR regarding Alphastar is unbelievably bafflingg.,1,362,169,1572799075,"[d] deepmind's pr regarding alphastar is unbelievably bafflingg. david silver hinted that deepmind is done with starcraft in bbc news article saying ""the lab may rest now"" and that they have ""completed the starcraft challenge"".

i thought this was a little disappointing since the skill level alphastar reached on ladder was not enough to beat professional players. i think we all wanted a real nice showdown between the human champion and the robot, right? that'd been pretty cool. 

the nature paper had a nice graph depicting alphastar's mmr which is basically blizzard's version of elo rating. the protoss agent had reached an mmr of ~6200 and the aggregate of all three races was 6030 iirc. the graph also had mmr's of alphastar's opponents and information on whether the agent won or lost.

basically alphastar had lost all but 2 games against players who had higher than 6200 mmr. on ladder, it could not beat the professional. 

the agent from january was estimated to have been over 7000 mmr. i figured it'd be nice to estimate how well this newest agent would have faired against mana.

so i looked at the eu ladder, found someone with an mmr of ~6200. popped him and mana into aligulac (sc2 database) and let it estimate some odds. mana had ~75% chance of winning a best of 5, and his 6200 mmr opponent had less than 1% chance of beating mana 5-0. 

at this point i became convinced that deepmind was throwing in the towel on sc2 because the cost of further improving alphastar was too high to justify the publicity they were getting from the project. the team looked to be moving on to different things and the showmatch vs the world champion had been cancelled. 

but then something absolutely baffling happened which i don't think anyone saw coming.

blizzcon was this weekend. with little to no fanfare deepmind had brought alphastar with them and let blizzcon visitors play against it. serral, one of the best players in the world, had just finished top 4 in the biggest tournament of the year wandered to the arcade and played a few games against the bot. serral's mmr is over 7000. 

he lost 0-3 to the protoss agent. these games were not televised. all we have is some blurry smartphone footage. 

i don't get it. if alphastar was this strong why didn't deepmind let it play more on ladder and get a higher ranking? why didn't they organize a showmatch or something? they dropped the ball pretty hard on this one. this is so confusing to me.",64,2395,8,419

then i also studied their referenced papers and realised that many of them use a train-test split strategy for evaluating their models. this means that they use a part of the evaluation dataset for finetuning their already trained model and then evaluate it on the testing part of the same dataset. in the case of these papers, this fact was explicitly mentioned. i think that this also happened in the paper i tried to reproduce. however, they don't mention it.

1,[Discussion] A Questionable SIGIR 2019 Paper,1,361,118,1572632241,"[discussion] a questionable sigir 2019 paper i recently read the paper ""adversarial training for review-based recommendations"" published on the sigir 2019 conference. i noticed that this paper is almost exactly the same as the paper ""why i like it: multi-task learning for recommendation and explanation"" published on the recsys 2018 conference.

at first, i thought it is just a coincidence. it is likely for researchers to have similar ideas. therefore it is possible that two research groups independently working on the same problem come up with the same solution. however, after thoroughly reading and comparing the two papers, now i believe that the sigir 2019 paper is plagiarizing the recsys 2018 paper.

the model proposed in the sigir 2019 paper is almost a replicate of the model in the recsys 2018 paper. (1) both papers used an adversarial sequence-to-sequence learning model on top of the matrix factorization framework. (2) for the generator and discriminator part, both papers use gru for generator and cnn for discriminator. (3) the optimization methodology is the same, i.e. alternating optimization between two parts. (4) the evaluations are the same, i.e. evaluating mse for recommendation performance and evaluating the accuracy for discriminator to show that the generator has learned to generate relevant reviews. (5) the notations and also the formulas that have been used by the two papers look extremely similar.

while ideas can be similar given that adversarial training has been prevalent in the literature for a while, it is suspicious for the sigir 2019 paper to have large amount of text overlaps with the recsys 2018 paper.

consider the following two sentences:

(1) ""the deep cooperative neural network (deepconn) model user-item interactions based on review texts by utilizing a factorization machine model on top of two convolutional neural networks."" in section 1 of the sigir 2019 paper.

(2) ""deep cooperative neural network (deepconn) model user-item interactions based on review texts by utilizing a factorization machine model on top of two convolutional neural networks."" in section 2 of the recsys 2018 paper.

i think this is the most obvious sign of plagiarism. if you search google for this sentence using ""exact match"", you will find that this sentence is only used by these two papers. it is hard to believe that the authors of the sigir 2019 paper could come up with the exact same sentence without reading the recsys 2018 paper.

as another example:

(1) ""the decoder employs a single gru that iteratively produces reviews word by word. in particular, at time step $t$ the gru first maps the output representation $z\_{ut-1}$ of the previous time step into a $k$-dimensional vector $y\_{ut-1}$ and concatenates it with $\\bar{u\_{u}}$ to generate a new vector $y\_{ut}$. finally, $y\_{ut}$ is fed to the gru to obtain the hidden representation $h\_{t}$, and then $h\_{t}$ is multiplied by an output projection matrix and passed through a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary of the document to represent the probability of each word. the output word $z\_{ut}$ at time step $t$ is sampled from the multinomial distribution given by the softmax."" in section 2.1 of the sigir 2019 paper.

(2) ""the user review decoder utilizes a single decoder gru that iteratively generates reviews word by word. at time step $t$, the decoder gru first embeds the output word $y\_{i, t-1}$ at the previous time step into the corresponding word vector $x\_{i, t-1} \\in \\mathcal{r}\^{k}$, and then concatenate it with the user textual feature vector $\\widetilde{u\_{i}}$. the concatenated vector is provided as input into the decoder gru to obtain the hidden activation $h\_{t}$. then the hidden activation is multiplied by an output projection matrix and passed through a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary to represent the probability of each word given the current context. the output word $y\_{i, t}$ at time step $t$ is sampled from the multinomial distribution given by the softmax."" in section 3.1.1 of the recsys 2018 paper.

in this example, the authors of the sigir 2019 paper has replaced some of the phrases in the writing so that the two texts are not exactly the same. however, i believe the similarity of the two texts still shows that the authors of the sigir 2019 paper must have read the recsys 2018 paper before writing their own paper.

i do not intend to go through all the text overlaps between the two papers, but let us see a final example:

(1) ""each word of the review $r$ is mapped to the corresponding word vector, which is then concatenated with a user-specific vector. notice that the user-specific vectors are learned together with the parameters of the discriminator $d\_{\\theta}$ in the adversarial training of section 2.3. the concatenated vector representations are then processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected projection layer. the final output of the cnn is a sigmoid function which normalizes the probability into the interval of $\[0, 1\]$"", expressing the probability that the candidate review $r$ is written by user $u$."" in section 2.2 of the sigir 2019 paper.

(2) ""to begin with, each word in the review is mapped to the corresponding word vector, which is then concatenated with a user-specific vector that identifies user information. the user-specific vectors are learned together with other parameters during training. the concatenated vector representations are then processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected layer. the final output unit is a sigmoid non-linearity, which squashes the probability into the $\[0, 1\]$ interval."" in section 3.1.2 of the recsys 2018 paper.

there is one sentence (""the concatenated vector representations are ...... a fully-connected projection layer."") that is exactly the same in the two papers. also, i think concatenating the user-specific vectors to every word vector in the review is a very unintuitive idea. i do not think ideas from different research groups can be the same in that granularity of detail. if i were the authors, i will just concatenate the user-specific vectors to the layer before the final projection layer, as it saves computational cost and should lead to better generalization.

as a newbie in information retrieval, i am not sure if such case should be considered as plagiarism. however, as my professor told me that the sigir conference is the premier conference in the ir community, i believe that this paper definitely should not be published at a top conference such as sigir.

what makes me feel worse is that the two authors of this paper, dimitrios rafailidis from maastricht university, maastricht, netherlands and fabio crestani from università della svizzera italiana (usi), lugano, switzerland, are both professors. they should be aware that plagiarism is a big deal in academia.

the explosion in unstructured data, such as images, videos, sound records, and text, requires an effective solution for computer vision, voice recognition, and natural language processing. how to extract value from unstructured data poses as a big challenge for many enterprises.

ai, especially deep learning, has been proved as an effective solution. vectorization of data features enables people to perform content-based search on unstructured data. for example, you can perform content-based image retrieval, including facial recognition and object detection, etc.

while the original intent of this research was to identify the drivers of such cancellations and predict whether customers would cancel using classification (i.e. cancelling customer = 1, non-cancelling customer = 0), i wanted to investigate whether time series forecasting could be a good addition to this study.

the first step was using pandas for data manipulation, i.e. sorting the cancellations by week and then summing up to get the total number of cancellations every week.

following this, i decided to use both arima and lstm to predict future cancellations across the test set. this was done for two separate hotel datasets (h1 and h2).

interestingly, i found that lstm performed better on the more volatile dataset (h2), while arima showed more forecast accuracy on the dataset with a smoother trend (h1).

ultimately, doing this project reinforced to me that machine learning models like lstm are just like any other model - they are not necessarily suitable for all situations, and one needs to understand the data they are working with before selecting the model.

1,[D] Google is applying BERT to Search,1,568,59,1572052193,"[d] google is applying bert to search understanding searches better than ever before

if there’s one thing i’ve learned over the 15 years working on google search, it’s that people’s curiosity is endless. we see billions of searches every day, and 15 percent of those queries are ones we haven’t seen before--so we’ve built ways to return results for queries we can’t anticipate.

when people like you or i come to search, we aren’t always quite sure about the best way to formulate a query. we might not know the right words to use, or how to spell something, because often times, we come to search looking to learn--we don’t necessarily have the knowledge to begin with. 

at its core, search is about understanding language. it’s our job to figure out what you’re searching for and surface helpful information from the web, no matter how you spell or combine the words in your query. while we’ve continued to improve our language understanding capabilities over the years, we sometimes still don’t quite get it right, particularly with complex or conversational queries. in fact, that’s one of the reasons why people often use “keyword-ese,” typing strings of words that they think we’ll understand, but aren’t actually how they’d naturally ask a question. 

with the latest advancements from our research team in the science of language understanding--made possible by machine learning--we’re making a significant improvement to how we understand queries, representing the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of search. 

**applying bert models to search**  
last year, we [introduced and open-sourced](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) a neural network-based technique for natural language processing (nlp) pre-training called bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, or as we call it--[bert](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html), for short. this technology enables anyone to train their own state-of-the-art question answering system. 

this breakthrough was the result of google research on [transformers](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html): models that process words in relation to all the other words in a sentence, rather than one-by-one in order. bert models can therefore consider the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it—particularly useful for understanding the intent behind search queries.

but it’s not just advancements in software that can make this possible: we needed new hardware too. some of the models we can build with bert are so complex that they push the limits of what we can do using traditional hardware, so for the first time we’re using the latest [cloud tpus ](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-pods-break-ai-training-records)to serve search results and get you more relevant information quickly. 

**cracking your queries**  
so that’s a lot of technical details, but what does it all mean for you? well, by applying bert models to both ranking and featured snippets in search, we’re able to do a much better job  helping you find useful information. in fact, when it comes to ranking results, bert will help search better understand one in 10 searches in the u.s. in english, and we’ll bring this to more languages and locales over time.

particularly for longer, more conversational queries, or searches where prepositions like “for” and “to” matter a lot to the meaning, search will be able to understand the context of the words in your query. you can search in a way that feels natural for you.

to launch these improvements, we did a lot of [testing](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/users/) to ensure that the changes actually are more helpful. here are some of the examples that showed up our evaluation process that demonstrate bert’s ability to understand the intent behind your search.  


here’s a search for “2019 brazil traveler to usa need a visa.” the word “to” and its relationship to the other words in the query are particularly important to understanding the meaning. it’s about a brazilian traveling to the u.s., and not the other way around. previously, our algorithms wouldn't understand the importance of this connection, and we returned results about u.s. citizens traveling to brazil. with bert, search is able to grasp this nuance and know that the very common word “to” actually matters a lot here, and we can provide a much more relevant result for this query.

let’s look at another query: “do estheticians stand a lot at work.” previously, our systems were taking an approach of matching keywords, matching the term “stand-alone” in the result with the word “stand” in the query. but that isn’t the right use of the word “stand” in context. our bert models, on the other hand, understand that “stand” is related to the concept of the physical demands of a job, and displays a more useful response.

here are some other examples where bert has helped us grasp the subtle nuances of language that computers don’t quite understand the way humans do.

**improving search in more languages**  
we’re also applying bert to make search better for people across the world. a powerful characteristic of these systems is that they can take learnings from one language and apply them to others. so we can take models that learn from improvements in english (a language where the vast majority of web content exists) and apply them to other languages. this helps us better return relevant results in the many languages that search is offered in.

for featured snippets, we’re using a bert model to improve featured snippets in the two dozen countries where this feature is available, and seeing significant improvements in languages like korean, hindi and portuguese.

**search is not a solved problem**  
no matter what you’re looking for, or what language you speak, we hope you’re able to let go of some of your keyword-ese and search in a way that feels natural for you. but you’ll still stump google from time to time. even with bert, we don’t always get it right. if you search for “what state is south of nebraska,” bert’s best guess is a community called “south nebraska.” (if you've got a feeling it's not in kansas, you're right.)

language understanding remains an ongoing challenge, and it keeps us motivated to continue to improve search. we’re always getting better and working to find the meaning in-- and most helpful information for-- every query you send our way.

1,[D] Are small transformers better than small LSTMs?,1,126,47,1571748040,"[d] are small transformers better than small lstms? transformers are currently beating the state of the art on different nlp tasks.

some examples are:

* machine translation: transformer big + bt
* named entity recognition: bert large
* natural language inference: roberta

something i noticed is that in all of the papers, the models are massive with maybe 20 layers and 100s of millions of parameters.

of course, using larger models is a general trend in nlp but it begs the question if small transformers are any good. i recently had to train a sequence to sequence model from scratch and i was unable to get better results with a transformer than with lstms.

i am wondering if someone here has had similar experiences or knows of any papers on this topic.",51,710,8,117

i've written a new blog post (https://rajatvd.github.io/factor-graphs/) on an awesome visualization tool that i recently came across -- factor graphs. initially, i encountered them in the context of message passing on graphical models, but soon realized that they are useful in more general contexts.

this is the first post in a series that covers the basics and mainly focuses on understanding how factor graphs work as a virtualization tool, along with a cool example of a visual proof using them. in future posts, i plan to cover algorithms like message passing and belief propagation using this visualization framework. 

i made the animations using [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/), a math animation tool created by the amazing [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucyo_jab_esufrv4b17ajtaw). i built a small library, [manimnx](https://github.com/rajatvd/manimnx), on top of manim to help interface it with the graph package [networkx](https://networkx.github.io). you can find the code for the animations in this [github repo](https://github.com/rajatvd/factorgraphs).

1,[D] Design methodology for ML engineering.,1,239,23,1571613134,"[d] design methodology for ml engineering. i am currently preparing for ml engineer interviews and wanted to learn a design methodology to crack the design rounds. i have looked for standard resources but couldn't find any. so i thought of coming up with one on my own from my own experiences and material that i have read online. so below is an overview of the approach i have in my mind. please let me know what you think of it. 

&#x200b;

1. understand the use case. 
   1. figure out what can be solved deterministically 
   2. figure out what needs to be solved using ‘data + machine learning’
2. pose the problem(1.b) as a math problem. 
   1. come up with an objective that you want to optimize. 
3. select the right data set. 
   1. what data is needed. how is the labeling done/derived? 
   2. how do you deal with bias, skewed classes, 
4. feature engineering. 
   1. think about what(information) you need to solve the problem optimally. 
   2. what aspects from the data could you use to replicate findings in 4.a? 
   3. transform data into features and a form more apt for model’s learning
5. model selection:
   1. what model is best suited to solve the problem(2.a) at hand.
   2. are there any off the shelf(direct or transfer learning) that would help. 
6. training: 
   1. how will you train
   2. how will you handle: skewed classes and other problems associated with the dataset. 
   3. validation: what metrics, experiments do you conduct to validate the model’s learning. 
7. productionizing: 
   1. how will the solution be deployed? 
   2. performance monitoring, feedback loop/retrain,
   3. application scaling and model maintenance.",42,1622,6,309

1,[D] Jurgen Schmidhuber really had GANs in 1990,1,538,167,1571382526,"[d] jurgen schmidhuber really had gans in 1990 he did not call it gan, he called it curiosity, it's actually famous work, many citations in all the papers on intrinsic motivation and exploration, although i bet many gan people don't know this yet

i learned about it through his [inaugural tweet](https://twitter.com/schmidhuberai) on their [miraculous year](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html). i knew lstm, but i did not know that he and sepp hochreiter did all those other things 30 years ago. 

the blog sums it up in section 5 artificial curiosity through adversarial generative neural networks (1990)

> the first nn is called the controller c. c (probabilistically) generates outputs that may influence an environment. the second nn is called the world model m. it predicts the environmental reactions to c's outputs. using gradient descent, m minimises its error, thus becoming a better predictor. but in a zero sum game, c tries to find outputs that maximise the error of m. m's loss is the gain of c.  

> that is, c is motivated to invent novel outputs or experiments that yield data that m still finds surprising, until the data becomes familiar and eventually boring. compare more recent summaries and extensions of this principle, e.g., [ac09]. 

> gans are an application of adversarial curiosity [ac90] where the environment simply returns whether c's current output is in a given set [ac19].

so i read those referenced papers. [ac19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04493) is kinda modern guide to the old report [ac90](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/fki-126-90ocr.pdf) where the adversarial part first appeared in section: implementing dynamic curiosity and boredom, and the generative part in section: explicit random actions versus imported randomness, which is like gans versus conditional gans. [ac09](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/multipleways2009.pdf) is a survey from 2009 and sums it up: maximise reward for prediction error.

i know that ian goodfellow says he is the inventor of gans, but he must have been a little boy when jurgen did this in 1990. also funny that yann lecun described gans as ""the coolest idea in machine learning in the last twenty years"" although jurgen had it thirty years ago  

no, it is not the same as predictability minimisation, that's yet another adversarial game he invented, in 1991, section 7 of his [explosive blog post which contains additional jaw-droppers](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html)",46,2501,8,360

1,[N] Netflix and European Space Agency no longer working with Siraj Raval,1,877,304,1571112550,"[n] netflix and european space agency no longer working with siraj raval *according to article in [the register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/14/ravel_ai_youtube/)*:

a netflix spokesperson confirmed to the register it wasn’t working with raval, and the esa has cancelled the whole workshop altogether.

“the situation is as it is. the workshop is cancelled, and that’s all,” guillaume belanger, an astrophysicist and the integral science operations coordinator at the esa, told the register on monday.

raval isn’t about to quit his work any time soon, however. he promised students who graduated from his course that they would be referred to recruiters at nvidia, intel, google and amazon for engineering positions, or matched with a startup co-founder or a consulting client.

in an unlisted youtube video recorded live for his students discussing week eight of his course, and seen by el reg, he read out a question posed to him: “will your referrals hold any value now?”

“um, yeah they’re going to hold value. i don’t see why they wouldn’t. i mean, yes, some people on twitter were angry but that has nothing to do with… i mean… i’ve also had tons of support, you know. i’ve had tons of support from people, who, uh, you know, support me, who work at these companies.

*he continues to justify his actions:*

“public figures called me in private to remind me that this happens. you know, people make mistakes. you just have to keep going. they’re basically just telling me to not to stop. of course, you make mistakes but you just keep going,” he claimed.

*when the register asked raval for comment, he responded:*

**i've hardly taken any time off to relax since i first started my youtube channel almost four years ago. and despite the enormous amount of work it takes to release two high quality videos a week for my audience, i progressively started to take on multiple other projects simultaneously by myself – a book, a docu-series, podcasts, youtube videos, the course, the school of ai. basically, these past few weeks, i've been experiencing a burnout unlike anything i've felt before. as a result, all of my output has been subpar.**

**i made the [neural qubits] video and paper in one week. i remember wishing i had three to six months to really dive into quantum machine-learning and make something awesome, but telling myself i couldn't take that long as it would hinder my other projects. i plagiarized large chunks of the paper to meet my self-imposed one-week deadline. the associated video with animations took a lot more work to make. i didn't expect the paper to be cited as serious research, i considered it an additional reading resource for people who enjoyed the associated video to learn more about quantum machine learning. if i had a second chance, i'd definitely take way more time to write the paper, and in my own words.**

**i've given refunds to every student who's asked so far, and the majority of students are still enrolled in the course. there are many happy students, they're just not as vocal on social media. we're on week 8 of 10 of my course, fully committed to student success.**

“and, no, i haven't plagiarized research for any other paper,” he added.

when it comes to ml, specifically ml engineering (which is where i want to be), it feels like there's a mountain of things you have to know: software engineering principles, a variety of languages, algorithms and their complexities, software frameworks, statistics, mathematics, domain specific requirements. and i feel like the field is always changing and i'm never going to be ""informed"" as it were.

i feel like i've spent most of my master's degree just checking off the boxes to get my degree (while also paying for it) and i haven't had enough time to delve into ml and now that i'm 8 months out from being done i don't have the knowledge i need to actually move into this field. 

but when i read this sub i think that i'm never going to be ready to move into the field. i'm always going to be fighting to understand the math well enough but then i'm not going to have enough time to understand the frameworks or the software engineering. it feels like i'm the jack of all trades but the master of none.

we’ve implemented a couple of benchmarks for now - but we’ve made it open and free for anyone to add benchmarks and connect their repositories (including forks). if you find it useful, feel free to just go for it and add repos. 

open for suggestions and feedback!

cheers, robert",51,895,7,148

>how many yards will an nfl player gain after receiving a handoff?  
>  
>american football is a complex sport. from the 22 players on the field to specific characteristics that ebb and flow throughout the game, it can be challenging to quantify the value of specific plays and actions within a play. fundamentally, the goal of football is for the offense to run (rush) or throw (pass) the ball to gain yards, moving towards, then across, the opposing team’s side of the field in order to score. and the goal of the defense is to prevent the offensive team from scoring.  
>  
>in the national football league (nfl), roughly a third of teams’ offensive yardage comes from run plays.. ball carriers are generally assigned the most credit for these plays, but their teammates (by way of blocking), coach (by way of play call), and the opposing defense also play a critical role. traditional metrics such as ‘yards per carry’ or ‘total rushing yards’ can be flawed; in this competition, the nfl aims to provide better context into what contributes to a successful run play.  
>  
>as an “armchair quarterback” watching the game, you may think you can predict the result of a play when a ball carrier takes the handoff - but what does the data say? in this competition, you will develop a model to predict how many yards a team will gain on given rushing plays as they happen. you'll be provided game, play, and player-level data, including the position and speed of players as provided in the nfl’s next gen stats data. and the best part - you can see how your model performs from your living room, as the leaderboard will be updated week after week on the current season’s game data as it plays out.  
>  
>deeper insight into rushing plays will help teams, media, and fans better understand the skill of players and the strategies of coaches. it will also assist the nfl and its teams evaluate the ball carrier, his teammates, his coach, and the opposing defense, in order to make adjustments as necessary.  
>  
>additionally, the winning model will be provided to the nfl’s next gen stats group to potentially share with teams. you could help the nfl network generate models to use during games, or for pre-game/post-game breakdowns.",38,2390,7,400
1,"[Discussion] Exfiltrating copyright notices, news articles, and IRC conversations from the 774M parameter GPT-2 data set",1,213,65,1570644706,"[discussion] exfiltrating copyright notices, news articles, and irc conversations from the 774m parameter gpt-2 data set concerns around abuse of ai text generation have been widely discussed. in the [original gpt-2 blog post](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) from openai, the team wrote:

>due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale, we are only releasing a [much smaller version of gpt-2 along with sampling code](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/). we are not releasing the dataset, training code, or gpt-2 model weights. 

these concerns about mass generation of plausible-looking text are valid. however, there have been fewer conversations around the gpt-2 data sets themselves. google searches such as ""gpt-2 privacy"" and ""gpt-2 copyright"" consist substantially of spurious results. believing that these topics are poorly explored, and need further exploration, i relate some concerns here.

&#x200b;

inspired by [this delightful post about talktalk's *untitled goose game*](https://aiweirdness.com/post/188214106227/theres-a-game-called-untitled-goose-game-in), i used adam daniel king's [talk to transformer](https://talktotransformer.com/) web site to run queries against the gpt-2 774m data set. i was distracted from my mission of levity (pasting in snippets of [notoriously awful harry potter fan fiction](https://myimmortalrehost.webs.com/chapters122.htm) and like ephemera) when i ran into a link to a real twitter post. it soon became obvious that the model contained more than just abstract data about the relationship of words to each other. training data, rather, comes from a variety of sources, and with a sufficiently generic prompt, fragments consisting substantially of text from these sources can be extracted.

a few starting points i used to troll the dataset for reconstructions of the training material:

* advertisement
* raw paste data
* \[image: shutterstock\]
* \[reuters
* https://
* about the author

i soon realized that there was surprisingly specific data in here. after catching a specific timestamp in output, i queried the data for it, and was able to locate a conversation which i presume appeared in the training data. in the interest of privacy, **i have anonymized the usernames and twitter links in the below output, because gpt-2 did not.** 

**\[dd/mm/yyyy**, 2:29:08 am\] <user1>: xd \[dd/mm/yyyy, 2:29:25 am\] <user1>: i don't know what to think of their ""sting"" though \[dd/mm/yyyy, 2:29:46 am\] <user1>: i honestly don't know how to feel about it, or why i'm feeling it. \[dd/mm/yyyy, 2:30:00 am\] <user1> (<@user1>): ""we just want to be left alone. we can do what we want. we will not allow gg to get to our families, and their families, and their lives."" (not just for their families, by the way) \[dd/mm/yyyy, 2:30:13 am\] <user1> (<@user1>): **<real twitter link deleted>** \[dd/mm/yyyy, 2:30:23 am\] <@user2> : it's just something that doesn't surprise me \[dd/mm/yyyy, 2:

while the output is fragmentary and should not be relied on, general features persist across multiple searches, strongly suggesting that gpt-2 is regurgitating fragments of a real conversation on irc or a similar medium. the general topic of conversation seems to cover gamergate, and individual usernames recur, along with real twitter links. i assume this conversation was loaded off of pastebin, or a similar service, where it was publicly posted along with other ephemera such as minecraft initialization logs. regardless of the source, this conversation is now shipped as part of the 774m parameter gpt-data set. 

this is a matter of grave concern. **unless better care is taken of neural network training data, we should expect scandals, lawsuits, and regulatory action** to be taken against authors and users of gpt-2 or successor data sets**,** particularly in jurisdictions with stronger privacy laws. for instance, use of the gpt-2 training data set as it stands may very well be in violation of the european union's gdpr regulations, insofar as it contains data generated by european users, and i shudder to think of the difficulties in effecting a takedown request under that regulation — or a legal order under the dmca. 

&#x200b;

here are some further prompts to try on talk to transformer, or your own local gpt-2 instance, which may help identify more exciting privacy concerns!

* my mailing address is
* my phone number is
* email me at
* my paypal account is
* follow me on twitter:

did i mention the dmca already? this is because my exploration also suggests that **gpt-2 has been trained on copyrighted data**, raising further legal implications. here are a few fun prompts to try:

since people recognized that es can solve rl-tasks, which the es community knew more than 10 years ago, we have a crazy amount of rl algorithms based on es. however, the ml/rl field is not looking at what the es community is doing, but is basically repeating the same mistake the community did more than 20 years ago. the openai paper would not pass any review in an es track at gecco because the algorithm would not be even considered a valid baseline anymore. while it is okay for the first paper reintroducing this to not know stuff, it is not okay for the follow-up work. this ignorance of sota in the field while knowing that the field exists is worrying.

the deep learning (dl) neural networks (nns) of our team have revolutionised pattern recognition and machine learning, and are now heavily used in academia and industry. in 2020, we will celebrate that many of the basic ideas behind this revolution were published three decades ago within fewer than 12 months in our ""annus mirabilis"" or ""miraculous year"" 1990-1991 at tu munich. back then, few people were interested, but a quarter century later, nns based on these ideas were on over 3 billion devices such as smartphones, and used many billions of times per day, consuming a significant fraction of the world's compute.

the following summary of what happened in 1990-91 not only contains some high-level context for laymen, but also references for experts who know enough about the field to evaluate the original sources. i also mention selected later work which further developed the ideas of 1990-91 (at tu munich, the swiss ai lab idsia, and other places), as well as related work by others.

there will be workshops at neurips 2019 (vancouver, canada) and amld 2020 (lausanne, switzerland) that will focus on this matter as well.

machine learning is not a miracle cure and cannot solve all climate change related problems. policy makers must decide to act to drive large-scale progress. but ml is an invaluable tool which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in many domains and sometimes even help create better policies, as the research shows.

1,[D] Is there a way to introduce a rating system for an isolated game tournament that could produce better results than simple overall winning percentage?,1,68,23,1569270037,"[d] is there a way to introduce a rating system for an isolated game tournament that could produce better results than simple overall winning percentage? hello /r/machinelearning! long time redditor, first time posting here. i hope this isn't too weird of a question.

i'm not looking for someone to do this or anything, this is a conceptual question. it is: **is there a way to introduce a rating system for an isolated game tournament that could produce better results than simple overall winning percentage?**

this idea came about because my dad's friends host a euchre tournament every year. for those that don't know, euchre is a 2v2 card game, and you play to 10 points.

now this is a friendly tournament among friends, so it's not like a cut-throat competition. there are players there with a variety of skill levels.

currently, you just sort of play all day with who is available, and you try not to play with the same person as your teammate all day (that way the two best players don't just team up all day and have a great record together). you only keep track of wins and losses. at the end of the day, the top 4 winning percentages go into a bracket for the title. we probably play around 20-30 games throughout the day, so the sample size is low.

there are numerous weaknesses to this method. i used to work for a game dev studio and really love game design, so it's a natural hobby of mine to assess the potential exploitation methods. again, it's a friendly competition, so i don't believe anyone is actively practicing any of the below, but there absolutely are some ways that this method falls *very* flat.

**1.  there is an active incentive to stop when you're ahead.**

towards the end of the day, if your winning percentage is high, you basically don't want to play games anymore. winning will hardly move your winning percentage up, but a loss can tank your great percentage by a lot.

**2. you can absolutely game the system with partner selection and opponent avoidance**

if you play games with the people who you know are the best, and play against players who are known to be poor, you can dramatically affect your winning percentage. if a very poor player asks you to be their partner, especially if you go up against a strong team, you're at a huge disadvantage. if you keep playing these games, your odds aren't 50/50 to win, but probably more like 75/25 in worst or best case scenarios. this kind of manipulation is incentivized by the rule structure, and a player playing with truly random partners/opponents would be at a disadvantage.

**3. scoring is completely ignored**

losing by 10 or losing by 1 doesn't matter at all. this is a huge mechanical weakness in my view. if you get behind in a game, there's a good incentive to try to play aggressively to catch up, but if you come back from being down 7-0 and lose 10-9, you get no points whatsoever for making a great comeback. in the interest of time, it would likely be worth more to just lose the game quickly and start a new one.


--------------------------------

there are more criticisms at play here, but these are the main ones i could think of.

how could you go about designing a system that might help mitigate some of these factors? i thought about instituting an elo-style (or glicko) rating system, but i'm not sure how it would play out given an internal tournament. we also wouldn't want legacy rankings because lower-ranked players would never make it far enough up the leaderboard to enter the finals.

is there any sort of system that constantly re-evaluates all the permutations of games that have happened and spits out a ranking of sorts? something that could actually take into account having a close loss when you have a weak teammate and strong opponents? it would basically take the entire tournament results as a whole, figure out all the rankings and decide on a top 4 players for the tournament.

is this a concept that exists, or how could current practices apply here?",153,3839,25,663

however, almost all of the versions i can find have missing/incomplete documentation.  many have the ""present residence since"" field which takes values in {1, 2, 3, 4}, with no note on what those discretizations mean.  it also lacks essential data e.g. when the data was collected and by what means.

chasing down the citations, it looks like the original data set comes from this paper on cart from 1990:

translated:
> hofmann h. j. ""the application of the cart method for statistical credit analysis of consumer credit"". journal of business administration, 60:941–962, 1990

i can't find that article anywhere.  google scholar only has citations to it, springerlink doesn't have that volume, my own university's library only has much older and much newer volumes, and a german library network i searched only had links to some swiss libraries which in turn linked back to springerlink.  from the uci link above, it appears that dr. hofmann was affiliated with the university of hamburg around 1994 with the first name hans, however i was (unsurprisingly) unable to find a page for a professor from 25 years ago.  there are also notable hans j hofmann's in chemistry and anthropology, which complicates the search for this author.

it troubles me that such a commonly-used data set has no clear source.  can anyone find the original publication of this data set, and/or an original version of the data and documentation?  the various versions available online (some with different variable encodings!) suggest that comparisons between papers that use this data set could be leading to false conclusions in our field (on top of the issue of so many papers being based off a single test set).",77,2467,15,346

1,[P] Gobbli: A Python Framework for Text Classification Projects,1,211,26,1568810443,"[p] gobbli: a python framework for text classification projects at my day job, we do a lot of text classification projects with small/medium size data. recent advances in transfer learning for nlp have moved these types of projects from impossible to feasible, especially for batch classification tasks we see frequently on survey projects with free-text responses. models like bert have been documented for research, and in trying to use them we found ourselves spending a lot of time extending them to the non-benchmarking applications and datasets we were curious about. given these issues, we built a framework for text classification projects that aims to make the consistent application of transfer learning and other models easier.

for a little more context, we started trying out bert last year and new models continued to be rapidly released. every time there was a new model there was a new api to learn. pytorch-transformers from huggingface helped a lot with this standardization issue, so we also took a look at what happens before a model is built (data processing and augmentation) and afterwards (model evaluation), and built supporting tools around those problems as well.

in addition, since most models require gpus, so we were spending a lot of time configuring environments, code, and data in tandem with docker which gets messy. because of this, we've abstracted most of that orchestration out so most everything is python code.

details on the library are below. we've battle tested it on a few projects and are curious to have others kick the tires and give us feedback if you're doing text classification.

tldr: hide and seek game where there are moveable blocks + ramps. hiders and seekers learn to use them to complete task. trained with ppo + transformer nn for representing objects

abstract: through multi-agent competition, the simple objective of hide-and-seek, and standard reinforcement learning algorithms at scale, we find that agents create a selfsupervised autocurriculum inducing multiple distinct rounds of emergent strategy, many of which require sophisticated tool use and coordination. we find clear evidence of six emergent phases in agent strategy in our environment, each of which
creates a new pressure for the opposing team to adapt; for instance, agents learn to build multi-object shelters using moveable boxes which in turn leads to agents discovering that they can overcome obstacles using ramps. we further provide evidence that multi-agent competition may scale better with increasing environment complexity and leads to behavior that centers around far more human-relevant skills than other self-supervised reinforcement learning methods such as intrinsic motivation. finally, we propose transfer and fine-tuning as a way to quantitatively evaluate targeted capabilities, and we compare hide-and-seek agents to both intrinsic motivation and random initialization baselines in a suite of domain-specific
intelligence tests.",50,1494,7,191

https://github.com/santosh-gupta/speedtorch

this is library i made for pytorch, for fast transfer between pinned cpu tensors and gpu pytorch variables. the inspiration came from needed to train large number of embeddings, which don't all fit on gpu ram at a desired embedding size, so i needed a faster cpu <-> gpu transfer method. this also allows using any optimizer for sparse training, since every embedding contained in the pytorch embedding variable receives an update, previously only pytorch's sgd, adagrad, and sparseadam were suitable for such training. 

in addition to augmenting parameter sizes, you can use to increase the speed of which data on your cpu is transferred to pytorch cuda variables. 

also, speedtorch's gpu tensors are also overall faster then pytorch cuda tensors, when taking into account both transferring two and from (overall 2.6x faster). for just transfering to a pytorch cuda, pytorch is still faster, but significantly slower when transfering from a pytorch cuda variable. 

i have personally used this to nearly double the embedding size of embeddings in two other projects, by holding half the parameters on cpu. the training speed is decent thanks to the fast cpu<->gpu exchange.

i’m paraphrasing / simplifying so it’s probably not completely accurate, but it looks like this tries to patent:

1.  receiving training data from channels on-board (not external to) a mobile machine;

2.  determining training features/data and corresponding labels from the training data;

3.  where the labels/data relate to different machine actions (as opposed to simply active or inactive) each occurring over different time periods;

4.  building the classifier by feeding training features/data and labels into a ml algorithm.

surely this was known prior to the sept. 2014 filing date of this patent.  is anyone else looking for a green light to continue to innovate in this space?  would be curious if anyone is aware of, or can find, an earlier public document that overlaps with the main claims of this patent. thanks!! ps – yes, i’ve googled and found some relevant documents, but have not yet found a single document that expressly includes all 4 items listed above. ",131,1327,20,182

\-storing the datasets in a central (hosted?) location, and version controlling them as needed, with minimal overhead

\-allowing for querying and visual exploration of the datasets for quick adjustment or examination of labels

\-efficiently pulling a dataset or subset of a dataset to a local machine.

\-automating the flow of datasets as much as possible, i.e. train x model on y subset of z dataset.

\-compressing less frequently used data as much as possible for ""cold storage"" and handling uncompression/recompression when the data is needed for training or when new data is added

&#x200b;

so far we've used 3 solutions:

1. storing everything on a local machine sitting under an unoccupied desk, and everybody manually updated the data there
2. storing compressed tar files of the data on aws storage and retrieving/updating it manually every so often.
3.  assigning one of the data labellers to spend some time as a ""dataset manager"" and try to do this for us.

each of these has had it's own set of problems, and i feel i waste a lot of time dealing with the overhead of this stuff.

how do you guys deal with this situation? is there an ""industry standard"" correct way of managing this stuff? like a github for cv? at places like waymo/tesla for example where they are constantly growing and updating their dataset to improve weak points, i would think an elegant solution for this has been devised.

one caveat is that i'd like to avoid using things like aws and azure ml ""low code"" services that might do some data management for you but then take away most of the freedom of working in tf/pytorch, and make the model into a black box.",71,1890,12,314

this blog post discusses a new optimizer built on top of adam, [introduced in this paper by liyuan liu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03265v1). essentially, they seek to understand why a warmup phase is beneficial for scheduling learning rates, and then identify the underlying problem to be related to high variance and poor generalization during the first few batches. they find that the issue can be remedied by using either a warmup/low initial learning rate, or by turning off momentum for the first couple of batches. as more training examples are fed in, the variance stabilizes and the learning rate/momentum can be increased. they therefore proposed a rectified adam optimizer that dynamically changes the momentum in a way that hedges against high variance. the author of the blog post tests an implementation in fastai and finds that radam works well in many different contexts, enough to take the leaderboard of the imagenette mini-competition.

my question is specifically about ""quant researcher"" type careers, and what the pros/cons and other considerations are when taking up a job like that.

my understanding is that post-phd (in ml, or whatever the department is that accommodated your ml research for the bulk of the phd), the majority of people aim for (1) ""research scientist"" roles in industry, or (2) focus more on an academic career, or (3) both, simultaneously. obviously this is a generalization, and there are many more things you can do with any stem phd for that matter, but these options seem to be the goals of many people.

what about (4) quant jobs in finance, such as in small/large trading / hedge funds / asset management / etc.? they frequently appear to offer extremely attractive packages, and require no experience in finance. however, for the most part the community seems to be rather separate from the (1) through (3) crowd i mentioned above, so i am unable to get a coherent picture of why some folks choose one path versus another, and the various things you should consider (e.g. long-term career trajectory, exit options, etc.) when taking your first job / internship in finance during / after your phd.

apologies for the naive question, and apologies again if this is not the right place to ask this kind of thing. thank you in advance for your kind advice!",52,1596,7,273
1,[D] Is Neuroscience background useful for ML research?,1,41,47,1566174451,"[d] is neuroscience background useful for ml research? is there anybody with neuroscience background who moved to ml research?
any ml researchers who deliberately decided to learn some neuroscience to get new ideas?

would you say it was worth it to learn neuroscience for you?
would you say it would be better to just focus purely on ml?

i am finishing my cs undergrad and deciding between two options for grad school:
1) phd in optimization/ml theory
2) ms in neuroinformatics (and then eventually going for phd in ml theory)

i am generally interested in learning neuroscience and understanding how the brain works. however, it seems the theory is not quite here yet, and i do not want to work on experimental biological side. i ultimately want to work on ml theory as i think ml has the most impact here and now, while it will likely take some decades until neuroscience is sufficiently developed. that is why i am considering to learn some core neuroscience concepts, and then try to apply those concepts to find novel ideas for ml.

the neuroinformatics ms program is quite flexible and will allow me to be primarily focused on ml and open-ended research, while 1/3 of my courses will be in neuroscience. i will work on bio-plausible backprop (some references are [here](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/16269/is-back-prop-biologically-plausible)) and maybe spiking neural networks. somewhat unrelatedly, being there may give me some insight into brain-computer interfaces research while there is growing interest in that. 

i think doing that ms will give me more diverse background and ideas for further research in ml theory, and open more doors. however, i am somewhat concerned if it is worth it, wouldn't doing pure ml leave me in in a better position?

also, i am a bit sceptical about bio-plausible ml research. while it is really interesting, it seems to be a bit of a ""toy"" problem. we don't even know if something like backprop happens in the brain, so trying to make it more ""bio-plausible"" for its own sake is somewhat of an artificial problem.

abstract

implementations utilize deep reinforcement learning to train a policy neural network that parameterizes a policy for determining a robotic action based on a current state. some of those implementations collect experience data from multiple robots that operate simultaneously. each robot generates instances of experience data during iterative performance of episodes that are each explorations of performing a task, and that are each guided based on the policy network and the current policy parameters for the policy network during the episode. the collected experience data is generated during the episodes and is used to train the policy network by iteratively updating policy parameters of the policy network based on a batch of collected experience data. further, prior to performance of each of a plurality of episodes performed by the robots, the current updated policy parameters can be provided (or retrieved) for utilization in performance of the episode.",78,1161,10,155

the technology used to generate audio on this site is a combination of two neural network models that were trained using audio data of dr. peterson speaking, along with the transcript of his speech. if you don't know who jordan peterson is or what his voice sounds like, you can find links to his podcast, lectures, and youtube videos on his website.

the first model, developed at google, is called tacotron 2. it takes as input the text that you type and produces what is known as an audio spectrogram, which represents the amplitudes of the frequencies in an audio signal at each moment in time. the model is trained on text/spectrogram pairs, where the spectrograms are extracted from the source audio data using a fourier transform.

the second model, developed at nvidia, is called waveglow. it acts as a vocoder, taking in the spectrogram output of tacotron 2 and producing a full audio waveform, which is what gets encoded into an audio file you can then listen to. the model is trained on spectrogram/waveform pairs of short segments of speech.

the implementations used to create this site were forked from nvidia's public implementations of waveglow and tacotron 2.",90,1219,14,196

our  codebase is capable of efficiently training a 72-layer, 8.3  billion  parameter gpt2 language model with 8-way model and 64-way data   parallelism across 512 gpus. we find that bigger language models are   able to surpass current gpt2-1.5b wikitext perplexities in as little as 5   epochs of training.  
for bert  training our repository trains bert large on 64 v100 gpus in  3 days. we  achieved a final language modeling perplexity of 3.15 and  squad  f1-score of 90.7.

their submission is not in the leaderboard of squad, but this exceeds the previous best single model performance (roberta 89.8).

for  language modelling they get zero-shot wikitext perplexity of 17.4 (8.3b  model) better than 18.3 of transformer-xl (257m). however they claim it  as sota when gpt-2 itself has 17.48 ppl, and another model has 16.4 ([https://paperswithcode.com/sota/language-modelling-on-wikitext-103](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/language-modelling-on-wikitext-103))

i have a couple of interviews coming up for research scientist roles with faang-like companies and since it's my first time going through this process (finishing grad school, never applied to industry positions before) i was wondering how the interviews are conducted and what they look at the most. i can find tons of information on the recruitment process for swe at big n companies, and how you have to grind leetcode for months to pass the coding bar, but not much info on the more research oriented roles. do they have the same bar for coding? do they put more emphasis on your performance during the ml and design interviews? what ""signal"" do they look for, presumably outside of your research portfolio, which they'd know already by the time you come for an onsite?

finally, in case anyone here works at a the research groups in major tech companies, what's been in your experience the interview:offer ratio, is it as bad as for developer roles (i read that for google it is about 1:7)? i would imagine that for research roles, it is easier to see if there is a good fit on data outside of algo&ds / design interview performance, like research interests and publication record, but maybe i am naive.

the microscopic assessment of tissue samples is instrumental for the diagnosis and staging of cancer, and thus guides therapy. however, these assessments demonstrate considerable variability and many regions of the world lack access to trained pathologists. though artificial intelligence (ai) promises to improve the access and quality of healthcare, the costs of image digitization in pathology and difficulties in deploying ai solutions remain as barriers to real-world use. here we propose a cost-effective solution: the augmented reality microscope (arm). the arm overlays ai-based information onto the current view of the sample in real time, enabling seamless integration of ai into routine workflows. we demonstrate the utility of arm in the detection of metastatic breast cancer and the identification of prostate cancer, with latency compatible with real-time use. we anticipate that the arm will remove barriers towards the use of ai designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis.

1,[D] CNN Image Segmentation: Why do UNET-like architectures outperform sliding-window approaches?,1,44,21,1565520928,"[d] cnn image segmentation: why do unet-like architectures outperform sliding-window approaches? i'm writing a thesis that heavily focuses on semantic segmentation of biomedical images.

i'm reviewing different segmentation approaches, identifying two main approach branches:

* a **sliding window**\-like approach: a classification network is used over different patches of original image to reconstruct a pixel-by-pixel estimates of the probability maps.
* a **full-image** approach: like the fcnn and unet approach, rely on fully convolutional architectures and the upscaling phase is incorporated in the network itself using transposed convolutions.[https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)

the second approach clearly outperforms the first one. i have a vague hunch on why this happens: my hypothesis is that the transposed-convolution operations, being at their core local operations, force local criteria on the segmentation of close pixels so that pixel contiguity is heavily encouraged in the fully convolutional case.

i do not find this kind of explanation satisfying because of two reasons:

1. i do not have papers or real data to support this: i cannot seem to find any paper on the theme.
2. the sliding-window approach has a built-in form of local consistency as well: if overlapping windows share most of the pixels it's reasonable to think that - given the network is not totally chaotic and shows enough linearity - the outputs would be similar.

do anyone have a bit of insight or source on any of this? any contribution, even brainstorming or unsupported hypothesis (like mine) is well appreciated.",96,1550,11,223

1,[N] AI pioneer Marvin Minsky accused of having sex with trafficking victim on Jeffrey Epstein’s island,1,604,310,1565454271,"[n] ai pioneer marvin minsky accused of having sex with trafficking victim on jeffrey epstein’s island a victim of billionaire jeffrey epstein testified that she was forced to have sex with mit professor marvin minsky, as revealed in a newly unsealed deposition. epstein was registered as a sex offender in 2008 as part of a controversial plea deal. more recently, he was arrested on charges of sex trafficking amid a flood of new allegations.

minsky, who died in 2016, was known as an associate of epstein, but this is the first direct accusation implicating the ai pioneer in epstein’s broader sex trafficking network. the deposition also names prince andrew of britain and former new mexico governor bill richardson, among others.

the accusation against minsky was made by virginia giuffre, who was deposed in may 2016 as part of a broader defamation suit between her and an epstein associate named ghislaine maxwell. in the deposition, giuffre says she was directed to have sex with minsky when he visited epstein’s compound in the us virgin islands.

as part of the defamation suit, maxwell’s counsel denied the allegations, calling them “salacious and improper.” representatives for giuffre and maxwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

a separate witness lent credence to giuffre’s account, testifying that she and minsky had taken a private plane from teterboro to santa fe and palm beach in march 2001. epstein, maxwell, chef adam perry lang, and shipping heir henry jarecki were also passengers on the flight, according to the deposition. at the time of the flight, giuffre was 17; minsky was 73.

a pivotal member of mit’s artificial intelligence lab, marvin minsky pioneered the first generation of self-training algorithms, establishing the concept of artificial neural networks in his 1969 book perceptrons. he also developed the first head-mounted display, a precursor to modern vr and augmented reality systems.

minsky was one of a number of prominent scientists with ties to jeffrey epstein, who often called himself a “science philanthropist” and donated to research projects and academic institutions. many of those scientists were affiliated with harvard, including physicist lawrence krauss, geneticist george church, and cognitive psychologist steven pinker. minsky’s affiliation with epstein went particularly deep, including organizing a two-day symposium on artificial intelligence at epstein’s private island in 2002, as reported by slate. in 2012, the jeffrey epstein foundation issued a press release touting another conference organized by minsky on the island in december 2011.

that private island is alleged to have been the site of an immense sex trafficking ring. but epstein associates have argued that those crimes were not apparent to epstein’s social relations, despite the presence of young women at many of his gatherings.

“these people were seen not only by me,” alan dershowitz argued in a 2015 deposition. “they were seen by larry summers, they were seen by \[george\] church, they were seen by marvin minsky, they were seen by some of the most eminent academics and scholars in the world.”

“there was no hint or suggestion of anything sexual or improper in the presence of these people,” dershowitz continued.

as a new rule, all beginner-level content should be posted to our sister sub, /r/learnmachinelearning.  this will free up “real estate” on our page for more in-depth, expert discussions and provide a more focused learning space for beginners.  that’s not to say that all tutorials are outright banned — in particular, explanations of recent or niche papers are still welcome.

we were all beginners once and newcomers to ml are bringing great things to this sub and the general community. please do continue to engage with and learn from the community here. but we recommend /r/learnmachinelearning if you do want to start getting your hands dirty

this is why i built [terrarium.ai](https://www.terrarium.ai/), a **persistent**, **online** **environment** where models control agents and fight for survival. i’ve just released the first version and i believe it is the first step towards **an entire universe of persistent online worlds for ai to live in**. 

**terrarium.ai is free**

i can't tell you how excited i am to share this, but i've received a bit of capital for this project. this means i can offer it to you all for free right now! absolutely no strings attached. the only thing i want right now is feedback so we can improve as fast as possible.

**development progress**

here's some insight into what i'm working on at the moment.  

right now agents can move, eat, and attack. they have energy and health which need to be minded in order to survive. i am working as hard as i can to add more features to the agents and environment. i really want to add this stuff, but i would like to get some feedback from you guys on how you would like to see them implemented.

if you are interested in using terrarium or contributing to its development, check out the website and feel free to email me or message me on reddit, twitter, or discord (info about this is on the website). i would love any feedback i can get in order to make terrarium a better experience. let me know what features you want prioritized, how you would like them to be implemented, or what problems you see with the platform that could be improved on!",50,1825,9,317

the london-based company also has more than a billion dollars of debt due for repayment this year, according to full-year accounts for the year ended dec. 31 posted to u.k. business registry companies house.

losses for 2018 widened to 470.2 million pounds ($572 million) from 302.2 million pounds in 2017. revenue rose to 102.8 million pounds, up from 54.4 million pounds. staff costs also nearly doubled against the year-ago period to 398 million pounds in 2018.

a debt of 1.04 billion pounds due this year includes an 883 million-pound loan from its owner. deepmind had written assurances it would be financially supported for at least another year.

“our deepmind for google team continues to make great strides bringing our expertise and knowledge to real-world challenges at google scale, nearly doubling revenue in the past year,” a spokeswoman for the company said in a statement. “we will continue to invest in fundamental research and our world-class, interdisciplinary team, and look forward to the breakthroughs that lie ahead.”

alphabet inc. bought deepmind for 400 million pounds in 2014. the next year, the company began working on health-care research, eventually creating an entire division dedicated to the area.

the company works with the u.k. national health service hospitals, researching algorithms that can diagnose eye diseases and spot head and neck cancers from medical imagery, and the u.s. department of veterans affairs on an algorithm that can predict which patients are at risk of sudden deterioration from acute kidney injury and other conditions.

tl;dr: [hyperparameterhunter](https://github.com/huntermcgushion/hyperparameter_hunter) 3.0 adds support for feature engineering optimization. define different feature engineering steps as normal functions, then let hyperparameterhunter keep track of the steps performed for experiments, so you can optimize them just like normal hyperparameters, and learn from past experiments automatically.

hyperparameterhunter is a scaffolding for ml experimentation and optimization. run one-off experiments or perform hyperparameter optimization, and hh automatically saves the model, hyperparameters, data, cv scheme, and now feature engineering steps, along with much more. future optimization will scour your saved experiments for those compatible with the current search space and use them to automatically jump-start learning.

* stop keeping janky lists of all your experiments’ conditions and results
* ensure optimization actually has sufficient data to be useful
* let no experiment be wasted

my name is dima and i wanted to tell you about an open-source library we work on called tamnunml.

our goal is to provide an easy to use library (with `sklearn` interface) for complex model training and fine-tuning.
for example, with `tamnun` you can train any `pytorch` module like this:

```python
from torch import nn
from tamnun.core import torchestimator

module = nn.linear(128, 2)
clf = torchestimator(module, task_type='classification').fit(train_x, train_y)
```

or, you can fine tune bert on your task as easy as:
```python
from tamnun.bert import bertclassifier, bertvectorizer
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

clf = make_pipeline(bertvectorizer(), bertclassifier(num_of_classes=2)).fit(train_x, train_y)
predicted = clf.predict(test_x)
```

at the moment `tamnun` supports training any (almost) pytorch using just a ""fit"" method, easy bert fine-tuning and model distillation.

**abstract**

>we propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. **the attention module** guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. unlike previous attention-based methods which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. moreover, our new **adalin (adaptive layer-instance normalization)** function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a **fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.**

to the reviewer that said our paper was ""underdeveloped"" because we didn't use a different methodology y from field z, we'd like to point out that a) this is in field a, b) we provided a framework for how to extend this to other methodologies in field a, and c) methodology y has no obvious way to extend to the problem we're addressing (and doing so would be a whole paper in its own right).  do you often read papers and get frustrated that they aren't the papers you've written?

to the same reviewer, who asked why we didn't cite papers z1 and z2, we would again point out that this isn't field z and those papers have no relevance to the topic at hand except that you'd have written a paper on a different topic, which we didn't.

to the reviewer that asked why we didn't cite x, we'd like to point out that we did cite x, and had a whole paragraph discussing the relationship of this work to that one.

to the reviewer that proposed an example dataset to evaluate our model on, we point out that we already evaluate the model on that data set; see our experiments section.

to the reviewer that pointed out that our method won't work when assumption 3 isn't met, yes, you're correct.  that's why we stated it as an assumption.  congratulations on your reading comprehension.

to the reviewer that directly copy/pasted our introduction into the ""what 3 things does this paper contribute"" box, we'll be sure to include in future revisions a copy/paste-able review justifying ""score 10, confidence 5"" to make your review easier.  that you also mischaracterized our main claim and completely missed the discussion on relationship to prior work makes your review particularly useful to development of the work.

to the reviewer that wrote that, while they were familiar with the definitions in a reference, we should explain it for readers that might be confused, we understand entirely.  we'll gladly explain it for ""a friend of yours"", err ""readers"", and not you, because you get it and you're smart and it's just the readers who don't.

to the reviewer who commented that our results were ""contradictory"" because we said that our modification ""in general performed slightly worse"" on this metric, when in fact our plots show it sometimes performed better, we'll gladly fix our claim to be clear that ""in general"" doesn't mean ""always"" and also our results are even better than the previous wording indicated.

to the reviewer that said our comparison method's results were worse than reported in the original paper, we've carefully compared their bar charts to ours and found that the results are the same to the precision of the graphical printout in the previous paper.  if you could lend us your image sharpening function so we can get more significant digits out of their plot, we'd be glad to redo the comparison.

to the reviewer who used half of their review to argue that our entire subfield is dumb and wrong, we thank them for reaching across academic lines to provide commentary in an area that pains you deeply.

and finally, to the reviewers who called our paper (all actual quotes) ""original, well-motivated, and worthy of study"", ""important in its own right"", that said you ""greatly enjoyed reading this paper"" and that ""this is an interesting problem and certainly worth studying"" and that ""this paper identifies an important problem ... [and the authors] then present a simple"" solution, thank you for also marking this a reject.  since all of you gave us scores between 5 and 3, neither the ac nor any of you will ever have to read this response or reconsider your scores before we are inevitably rejected, but we hope that your original, well-motivated, worth-studying, important, interesting, clear papers receive reviews of equal quality in the future!

1,"[D] On the viability of the ""AI Dungeon Master""",1,22,25,1564470388,"[d] on the viability of the ""ai dungeon master"" i originally posted this on /r/learnmachinelearning since it's technically a question, but i think it goes beyond the scope of questions like ""how do i set up tensorflow"" and is worth putting here well.

i love tabletop rpgs, and i'm specifically curious if there are any areas of current ml technology that might allow the nerd fantasy of an independent ai dungeon master to come true, whether fully or even partially.

for those unfamiliar with tabletop rpgs, i'll run over the basic gameplay loop, using dungeons & dragons as my example.

at the center of it all you have a system of core rules (easily programmable rules, in fact) which tracks character stats, specifics of movement, items, abilities, success/failure checks, and other details down to a very granular level. this part is easy for computers, evidenced by the fact that rpg video games derived from these rulesets.

however, with a tabletop rpg, the game is ran by a person known as the dungeon master or game master, who acts as a kind of referee for the rules. the dungeon master can take whatever request a player makes, then translate that request into something compatible with the rules.

this process of ""compiling"" a request into a rule check can be done for something simple, such as ""i attack the orc"" (damage based on a dice roll + weapon type + skill modifiers + proficiency bonus, etc.), or for something crazy and convoluted, such as ""i fashion the rope in my inventory into a lasso, toss it so that it loops around the damaged stone pillar at the other side of the chasm, then pull as hard as i can"" (dice roll based on the player's dexterity skill, then another based on their strength, success resulting in the pillar toppling and creating a bridge of rubble; player loses the rope item and is able to roll again with their acrobatics ability to cross the chasm without consequences).

so there is consistency mixed with inconsistency. a player's input can be wild and unpredictable, but it always resolves into rule checks that are consistent, mechanical, and easily understandable by a machine. the dungeon master is the missing link. the adjudication of a human brain allows players to interact with the rules in a way that's deeper and freer than clicking pre-programmed buttons to perform actions, which is why video games have never been able to replicate the feeling of a real tabletop rpg.

but now we have machine learning. what kind of ai, if any, could be used to taking ambiguous statements and convert them into standard game interactions? and to what extent could it be pushed? if it's impossible to account for everything (which i'm guessing it is, at least for now), then what kind of sacrifices could be made on the player's side (e.g. typing only short, simple requests in a specific format, or entering nouns and verbs into text boxes) to make it possible?",47,2865,9,486

[detecting dns threats: a deep learning model to rule them all](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334637849_detecting_dns_threats_a_deep_learning_model_to_rule_them_all)

abstract:

domain name service is a  central part of internet regular operation. such importance has made it a  common target of different malicious behaviors such as the application  of domain generation algorithms (dga) for command and control a group of  infected computers or tunneling techniques for bypassing system  administrator restrictions. a common detection approach is based on  training different models detecting dga and tunneling capable of  performing a lexicographic discrimination of the domain names. however,  since both dga and tunneling showed domain names with observable  lexicographical differences with normal domains, it is reasonable to  apply the same detection approach to both threats. in the present work,  we propose a multi-class convolutional network (mc-cnn) capable of  detecting both dns threats. the resulting mc-cnn is able to detect  correctly 99% of normal domains, 97% of dga and 92% of tunneling, with a  false positive rate of 2.8%, 0.7% and 0.0015% respectively and the  advantage of having 44% fewer trainable parameters than similar models  applied to dns threats detection.

there has been a lot of interest in specialized hardware for achieving high efficiency and performance on machine learning tasks. matrix-vector multiplications are one of the most important (and computationally expensive) operations in neural networks. it turns out that analog *optical* processors can perform these operations in **o(1) time** (rather than the  **o(n\^2) time** on gpus and cpus). these specialized onn processors, which are driven by modulated lasers, could potentially be scaled to use far less energy *per operation* than conventional digital processors.

of course, the other piece of the puzzle for neural networks is the **nonlinear activation function**. optics is excellent for performing linear operations, but nonlinearities are far more difficult, especially in on-chip circuits. basically, in nature, if you want to see something or to send information, you use light. but, if you want to make a decision on that information you use electrical charge. 

our paper (linked below) proposes a scheme for building a full onn with an activation function by coupling a small electrical circuit to the output of each onn layer. this electrical circuit converts a small amount of the optical signal into and electrical voltage, which then **nonlinearly modulates the optical signal**. we performed a benchmark of this onn on the mnist image recognition task and found that our activation function significantly boosted the classification accuracy of the onn, from \~85% without the activation to \~94% with the activation. this is still a bit below the performance achieved in state-of-the-art models, but our setup used only 16 complex fourier coefficients of the images as inputs (rather than all 784 pixels).

checkout the paper below and feel free to ask questions. our two python onn simulator packages (developed by two of my co-authors) are available on github: [https://github.com/fancompute/neuroptica](https://github.com/fancompute/neuroptica) and [https://github.com/solgaardlab/neurophox](https://github.com/solgaardlab/neurophox/). these repos include several examples if you're interested in playing around with training onns on a computer.

abstract:

over the last decade, artificial neural networks (anns), have undergone a  revolution, catalyzed in large part by better tools for supervised  learning. however, training such networks requires enormous data sets of  labeled examples, whereas young animals (including humans) typically  learn with few or no labeled examples. this stark contrast with  biological learning has led many in the ann community posit that instead  of supervised paradigms, animals must rely instead primarily on  unsupervised learning, leading the search for better unsupervised  algorithms. here we argue that much of an animal’s behavioral repertoire  is not the result of clever learning algorithms—supervised or  unsupervised—but arises instead from behavior programs already present  at birth. these programs arise through evolution, are encoded in the  genome, and emerge as a consequence of wiring up the brain.  specifically, animals are born with highly structured brain  connectivity, which enables them learn very rapidly. recognizing the  importance of the highly structured connectivity suggests a path toward  building anns capable of rapid learning.",93,1531,15,180

building an app to classify animals for the visually impaired. users have an app where they can take a picture and get the name of the animal. if the camera is being pointed somewhere with no animal, it should predict ""no animal"". but also, if the camera points at an animal that i don't have in my dataset, i'd like it to predict ""unrecognized animal"" so i can store the frame and the manually tag it and feed back to my training set.

here's what i'm thinking:

- on data: have varied images with no animals in them that the network should predict as ""no animal"". 
take a number of species and have them as ""unrecognized animal"" so the network **learns what it doesn't know** (the truth label would be [animal = 1, recognized = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0...] vs. the recognized animals e.g. [animal = 1, recognized = 1, 0, 0, 1, 0...]). i know the normal approach would be to decide ""unrecognized"" based on a threshold of the max predicted confidence, but several [papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04599.pdf) and empirical evidence show how overconfident nets can be...?). i'm not too sure.

- on loss function: i was just going to use cross entropy for each of the three terms (animal/no animal, recognized/not recognized, animal classification) and have them weighted.

is my approach in the right direction? i don't know how to express this problem well enough to find good results on google but this must have been solved before right?

the imagenet challenge competition was closed in 2017, as it was generally agreed in the machine learning community that the task of image classification was mostly solved and that further improvements were not a priority. it should be noted however that the imagenet test examples are mostly relatively uncluttered close-up images which do not represent the more challenging object contexts and representations found in real world.

what’s more, it has been shown that adversarial examples that succeed in fooling one classification model can also fool other models that use different architecture or were trained on different datasets. adversarial attacks therefore have the potential to cause serious and widespread security vulnerabilities across popular ai applications such as facial recognition, self-driving cars, etc.

1,[P] Playing RTS games with audio recognition instead of using hands for input,1,53,20,1563431694,"[p] playing rts games with audio recognition instead of using hands for input so about two years ago i started getting shoulder aches, but i still wanted to play rts games. that's when i started working on a project to allow me to play certain games without using my hands.

at first it started off with 100ms audio and a slow 80ms delay afterwards to respond to inputs, right now i've brought it down to 50ms audio with a response time of 10ms. 

also using an eyetracker to move the mouse around so that it's completely hands free.

&#x200b;

a demo where i'm using the program to play starcraft 2 can be found here with all the controls explained during the video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhqzrz3prtu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhqzrz3prtu)

&#x200b;

the project has the recording tools needed for data collection, using a sliding window over the microphone input to generate 50ms audio files every 25ms. 

i added some simple thresholding filters so that i can more easily get the right audio samples when i am recording them ( sibilants can get by with just a pitch threshold, others like finger snaps work best with high peak-peak thresholds )

&#x200b;

i'm using neural nets with four layers in an ensemble to do the recognition part, and do some post-processing to make sure keyboard-inputs are done at the proper times with as little mis-clicks as possible.

i validate out-of-sample performance by recording some more sounds and analysing the outputs of the model in a few graphs ( [https://github.com/chaosparrot/parrot.py/blob/master/docs/analysing.md](https://github.com/chaosparrot/parrot.py/blob/master/docs/analysing.md) ).

&#x200b;

the post-processing tweaks i do after playing a match in a game, and alter the thresholds for input activation based on my experience during it ( maybe i felt the shift key was pressed too late, or another key was way too trigger happy )

by analysing the model output of the match with the csv output of the recognitions.

&#x200b;

the program is multithreaded to ensure that i don't lose audio recordings during the feature-engineering/evaluation phase.

&#x200b;

a github with all the code can be found here: [https://github.com/chaosparrot/parrot.py](https://github.com/chaosparrot/parrot.py)

&#x200b;

as for the future, i think i want to make it record 30ms sounds read at 60hz, and maybe fool around with some cnns to see if it improves the recognition.

considering i also control the data collection, i can just add a few thousand more samples of certain sounds, so i might try training with 5000 samples per label instead of 1500.",77,2562,13,373

>deep neural networks (dnns) are found to be vulnerable against adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted inputs with a small magnitude of perturbation aiming to induce arbitrarily incorrect predictions. recent studies show that adversarial examples can pose a threat to real-world security-critical applications: a ""physical adversarial stop sign"" can be synthesized such that the autonomous driving cars will misrecognize it as others (e.g., a speed limit sign). however, these image-space adversarial examples cannot easily alter 3d scans of widely equipped lidar or radar on autonomous vehicles. in this paper, we reveal the potential vulnerabilities of lidar-based autonomous driving detection systems, by proposing an optimization based approach lidar-adv to generate adversarial objects that can evade the lidar-based detection system under various conditions. we first show the vulnerabilities using a blackbox evolution-based algorithm, and then explore how much a strong adversary can do, using our gradient-based approach lidar-adv. we test the generated adversarial objects on the baidu apollo autonomous driving platform and show that such physical systems are indeed vulnerable to the proposed attacks. we also 3d-print our adversarial objects and perform physical experiments to illustrate that such vulnerability exists in the real world.

1,[D] Dislike/Disinterest of Machine Learning: rant,1,94,63,1562914099,"[d] dislike/disinterest of machine learning: rant this is just my personal opinion/rant of what i inherently dislike about ml and neural networks after working on a research project involving a cnn for little under a year and feeling very frustrated with where it is going. not claiming to be an expert or professional in the field.

&#x200b;

**#1: machine learning is frustrating to code/improve on:**

&#x200b;

i find the coding of machine learning for a neural network (at least at my level when you are only really applying already existing layers/activation functions) to be very unsatisfying to progress through due to the nature of it. when you are solving a normal coding problem i feel like you can get creative with dealing with problems/issues that occur with your algorithm, as you progress through solving the problem (in my case getting high classification accuracy), but the solution offered by machine learning tends to be a sort of black box where it simply works at a certain percent for whatever rhyme or reason. i feel like the time i put into improving my classification accuracy is not proportional to the rate at which it improves and is more factored by chance than anything. for example i spent weeks changing the shape and setup of the input data, the number of nodes in each layer, etc with little to no improvement, but one day i switched the activation functions on my dense layers from relu to selu, and by literally changing 4 letters, my accuracy jumped past everything else that i had tried the last few weeks. this could just be due to my lack of experience in the field, i.e. a talented ml engineer could just tell based the loss function values that selu activation function will lead to improvement. i dislike how when i make a change to the net i don't really know how exactly that will translate to the result that i get. i could predict an improvement will happen, but i can't say for certain or really know to what degree an improvement will occur. this gets more frustrating when you have something that needs a lot of epochs to progress through that takes a long time, preventing you from just trying your more long shot ideas that might work but if they don't will just waste a lot of time with nothing gained.

&#x200b;

**#2: reliance on data set:**  

&#x200b;

this could just be a complaint about data science in general, i don't really know enough about the field to know where the distinction between the two is. i dislike how the prerequisite to solving problems using machine learning is to have a solid dataset that may be inherently biased in a way you can't predict. an analogy that comes to mind when i think about this is studying for a test. the non ml way to do it would be to build up an understanding of the material from the ground up that is solid enough to solve any problem thrown at you. the ml way to do it would be to gather up old tests that the professor gave in previous years and use those to study for the test. sure you might do better on the test in this way, but if a curve ball question ends up on the test it is more likely for the non ml way to be able to solve the question. even if they don't solve the question they can see where their logic in solving it was flawed, whereas in the ml case, the flawed logic was that the previous tests didn't have a question similar to this one. going off of this if your dataset has an inherent bias or is too small then your solution will share that bias and won't be trustworthy in a scenario that hasn't been seen before but still needs to be dealt with. now i know that there are methods to help with having a smaller dataset and preventing overfitting such as dropout layers and transfer learning, but i still have an underlying issue with needing to rely on this large dataset for solving your problem, especially in industries where the dataset isn't typically knowledge given to the public.

&#x200b;

**#3 disconnect between people suggesting ml learning solutions to problems and actual ml engineers who have to implement solutions:**

&#x200b;

**#4 constant research needed in newest techniques:**

&#x200b;

now some people might like this aspect of ml, but i dislike how you constantly need to be learning about the newest trends in ml in order to stay relevant. it seems like the things that i learn this year will become almost completely irrelevant next year i.e. rnns were thought to be very good for word processing until they found that cnns were better suited for it. now this occurs in all industries obliviously but i feel like it is especially true in ml, where you aren't just designing a system that will solve a problem, you are also designing a system to find the correct weights for said system, so i feel like there is a higher chance for something that you learned about and specialize in to one day become completely irrelevant and you need to now learn this unrelated new idea that will only last for so long.

&#x200b;

**#5 paywall in ml:**

&#x200b;

to even consider an ml solution to a problem you need two things: a good dataset and a lot of computing power. just having more computing power allows you to train and test your implementations at a much faster rate than someone without those resources. it ultimately comes down to the solution is inherently tied to having a large amount of money to put down before hand to solve the problem before seeing any real proof of concept (this could be wrong i am not very familiar with if there is a proof of concept somewhere in the ml life cycle). while i recognize that in all industries money always allows for better/quicker development, my problem arises when you consider someone learning ml from the ground up. if you have more money to spend on getting a better rig to learn ml, your shitty mnist dataset classifier will train significantly faster and allow you to learn significantly faster than someone with less money, which i think is an inherent problem of the method. talking about datasets, paying for datasets, and how companies take your data to be used in datasets for ml is a completely different rant so i'm just going to end it here.

the announcement is from the starcraft 2 official page. alphastar will play as an anonymous player against some ladder players who opt in in this experiment in the european game servers.

some highlights:

* alphastar can play anonymously as and against the three different races of the game: protoss, terran and zerg in 1vs1 matches, in a non-disclosed future date. their intention is that players treat alphastar as any other player.
* replays will be used to publish a peer-reviewer paper.
* they restricted this version of alphastar to only interact with the information it gets from the game camera (i assume that this includes the minimap, and not the api from the january version?).
* they also increased the restrictions of alphastar actions-per-minute (apm), according to pro players advice. there is no additional info in the blog about how this restriction is taking place.

personally, i see this as a very interesting experiment, although i'll like to know more details about the new restrictions that alphastar will be using, because as it was discussed here in january, such restrictions can be unfair to human players. what are your thoughts?",82,1248,11,184

other helpful notes:

* to share the generated card image, you can save as the generated card locally, and to use it elsewhere, rename it and add a .jpg file extension.
* the network can recite existing card names and rules text of existing cards, but rarely to the same card. the network often makes interesting color shift decisions with changes to cmc/rarity.
* in terms of color accuracy, color pie is mostly correct. creature types and mechanics often follow the appropriate color identity. p/t, mana cost, and rarity are balanced.
* the card formatting issues are due to the underlying mtgencode/mse implementations and are not easy to fix (most notable with planeswalker cards).

[code and pcb/cad design files here](https://github.com/paulklinger/rps-rnn)

i was looking for some kind of project that let me combine my love for building [small electronics/3d-printing projects](https://paulklinger.com/projects/) and machine learning, and this is what i came up with.

the machine learning side of this isn't too interesting, just [a small 3 layer vanilla rnn](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulklinger/rps-rnn/master/diagrams/rnn_architecture.png) (all layers with 10-d state, trained in tensorflow/keras) that takes as input the moves of the two players and outputs a prediction for the opponents next move. the data comes from [roshambo.me](https://roshambo.me) via this [blog article](https://roshambo.me/ via https://justincollier.com/life-hacks/how-to-win-rock-paper-scissors/). i added some simulated data of periodic sequences, because that seems like the sort of thing people might try out when playing against an ""ai"".

without the simulated data the model gets something like 38% accuracy on the test set (compared to 33% playing randomly). one nice thing about rock-paper-scissors is that you can't do much better than random, so there isn't much pressure ;)

i had some problems getting training with larger batches to work (either with just padding or padding and masking the gradients) so i just trained it with batch_size=1, which wasn't too bad for such a small network.

the probably more interesting part of this project is running that network on a small microcontroller. i quantized the network weights (to 8-bit integers) to save some space (it only has 2kib ram and 16kib flash, although the network i ended up using would actually fit without that). the calculations are done using software floats, as performance isn't really an issue. the c-code running on the microcontroller is all custom, not that it's particularly complicated.

the finished device is about the size of a coin (but thicker). it uses a custom pcb (ordered from [dirtypcbs](https://dirtypcbs.com/store/pcbs)), is powered by a coin cell battery, and has a nice 3d-printed case. the form-factor is pretty close to my [electronic dice](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/akrl7d/compact_universal_electronic_dice_building_small/) so that wasn't too much work.",142,2353,21,311

are we entering a maturity phase in dl? simply endlessly optimizing what we already know? where is the new epicenter of revolutionary thought? why is there so little talk of neuroscience/biology in the dl community despite the strong roots?

* simplicity : ***a network-independent optimum w.r.t. generalization***, and

we also provide preliminary evidence that layer rotations correlate with the degree to which intermediate features are learned during the training procedure.

**abstract**:  

our work presents extensive empirical evidence that layer rotation, i.e. the evolution across training of the cosine distance between each layer's weight vector and its initialization, constitutes an impressively consistent indicator of generalization performance. in particular, larger cosine distances between final and initial weights of each layer consistently translate into better generalization performance of the final model. interestingly, this relation admits a network independent optimum: training procedures during which all layers' weights reach a cosine distance of 1 from their initialization consistently outperform other configurations -by up to 30% test accuracy. moreover, we show that layer rotations are easily monitored and controlled (helpful for hyperparameter tuning) and potentially provide a unified framework to explain the impact of learning rate tuning, weight decay, learning rate warmups and adaptive gradient methods on generalization and training speed. in an attempt to explain the surprising properties of layer rotation, we show on a 1-layer mlp trained on mnist that layer rotation correlates with the degree to which features of intermediate layers have been trained.",89,2688,12,342

**abstract** the possible ways in which machinery might be made to show intelligent behaviour are discussed. the analogy with the human brain is used as a guiding principle. it is pointed out that the potentialities of the human intelligence can only be realised if suitable education is provided. the investigation mainly centres round an analogous teaching process applied to machines. the idea of an unorganised machine is defined, and it is suggested that the infant human cortex is of this nature. simple examples of such machines are given, and their education by means of rewards and punishments is discussed. in one case the education process is carried through until the organisation is similar to that of an [ace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automatic_computing_engine).

we thought that such a competition would need a big $ prize pool in order to attract talent to try help solve the ""starcraft problem"". we tried to copy the model of the original [xprize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ansari_x_prize) and use insurance bonds to try finance the $ prize purse.

one thing we realised, early circa 2018 is that there were no bringing rl down to earth courses out there to help people get involved in the envisioned starcraft competition. so we went ahead and made it ourselves :)

i wanted to share this paper we recently submitted to neurips. tl;dr - the idea is that there has been a lot of recent research on explaining deep learning models by attributing importance to each input feature. we go one step farther and incorporate *attribution priors* \- prior beliefs about what these feature attributions should look like - into the training process. we develop a fast, differentiable new feature attribution method called *expected gradients*, and optimize differentiable functions of these feature attributions to improve performance on a variety of tasks.

our results include: in image classification, we encourage smoothness of nearby pixel attributions to get more coherent prediction explanations and robustness to noise. in drug response prediction, we encourage similarity of attributions among features that are connected in a protein-protein interaction graph to achieve more accurate predictions whose explanations correlate better with biological pathways. finally, with health care data, we encourage inequality in the magnitude of feature attributions to build sparser models that perform better when training data is sparse. we hope this framework will be useful to anyone who wants to incorporate prior knowledge about how a deep learning model should behave in a given setting to improve performance.",55,1523,7,201

abstract: *we present a generalization of the cauchy/lorentzian, geman-mcclure, welsch/leclerc, generalized charbonnier, charbonnier/pseudo-huber/l1-l2, and l2 loss functions. by introducing robustness as a continuous parameter, our loss function allows algorithms built around robust loss minimization to be generalized, which improves performance on basic vision tasks such as registration and clustering. interpreting our loss as the negative log of a univariate density yields a general probability distribution that includes normal and cauchy distributions as special cases. this probabilistic interpretation enables the training of neural networks in which the robustness of the loss automatically adapts itself during training, which improves performance on learning-based tasks such as generative image synthesis and unsupervised monocular depth estimation, without requiring any manual parameter tuning.*

[unrolled summary](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1088679404937625600.html):

[how can you do great ai research when you don't have access to google-scale compute?](https://twitter.com/togelius/status/1088679404937625600) by being weird. the big tech companies are obsessed with staying nimble despite being big, and some succeed to some extent. but they can't afford to be as weird as a lone looney professor.
a lone professor with a handful of students and a few computers can never win over deepmind or fair in a straight competition. but we can afford to try methods that make absolutely no sense, or attack problems that nobody wants to solve as they don't look like problems.

to the extent i've done anything useful or worthwhile in my career, it's always been through trying to solve a problem nobody thought of, or trying a method that shouldn't work. very often the useful/publishable end result was nothing like what i thought i was working towards.

so go on, be weird. out-weird the giants. even if they're both nimble and powerful, they cannot be as stupid and ridiculous as you. because how would that look? to managers, investors, board members, the general public? you can afford to completely disregard such entities.

now, i'm not saying that there's no value in throwing giant compute resources at some problem, and trying to break a long-standing benchmark. that's all good, i'm happy that there are people that do those things. but i'm happy that i don't have to do it. because it's a bit boring

and of course the advantage of the big tech companies is not only in having many gpus. it's also in having large teams of highly competent people working on the project non-stop without having to e.g. teach or go to faculty meetings. still, you can do it.

one topic kept coming up though, with 15 out of the 17 interviewers, across all 5 companies (including two of the biggest names in tech) asking this exact question:

**suppose you have a binary classifier (logistic regression, neural net, etc...) how do you handle imbalanced data sets in production?**

i don't know :-( . i know that you need to be careful with which metric you use to evaluate your model, that you should look at precision and recall or the roc, instead of just accuracy. and that your sampling strategies should change to better reflect each class. but all of this is during training.

once in production, i know that you face a catch-22 situation:

* if you *don't skew* your training data, then you don't have enough data from the sparse class for the classifier to learn something, and it will just learn to always predict the dense class.
* if you *do skew* your data, then now you're facing a situation where the distribution of the training data and the distribution of the production data are completely different, so your model won't predict well (at least my understanding is that different distributions in test and in prod is always a recipe for disaster).

is my assessment of the dilemma correct? and how do you solve it?

why is this question so popular (fwiw - none of these companies were doing medical or security applications....)

&#x200b;

some follow up questions and/or hints that were given (but i still couldn't really answer the question in a satisfactory way): 

* if this is the case, but only you noticed that your binary classifier is not performing well only after you have already deployed it in production and had been scoring it for a few weeks, what do you do? (my answer, go back to training, and either re-evaluate which features you want to use, or find more data to train on) , second follow from the same person: what if i told you that you are stuck with the same model and couldn't get any more data, what do you do then (i answered: l1 or l2 regularization? but these are applicable to any data set, they aren't specific to imbalanced data. fiddle with the k in your k-fold cv? that wouldn't work either -- by this point i felt like i was being kobayashi marued...) 
* can you adjust your classifier after training, but before deploying it, so that it is adjusted to the original distribution, not the skewed (downsampled or upsampled) distribution you used during training? (drew a blank - as far as i know, any adjustment to the model based on knowledge prior to deployment constitutes training in one form or the other....) 

with regards to the second question, i did come across \[this thread and the blog that it linked to\]([https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/403244/89649](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/403244/89649)) . it applies only to logistic regression, not any other binary classifier as far as i can tell . what about other classifiers?

**abstract**

not all neural network architectures are created equal, some perform much better than others for certain tasks. but how important are the weight parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? in this work, we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. we propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. to evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. we demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. on a supervised learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on mnist using random weights.

meanwhile, some of the code that has been the most useful for my research has been appallingly written and some of the papers that i’ve found the most useful have been barely understandable and riddled with grammatical and even spelling mistakes.

1,[D] A few questions from a behavioral scientist on reinforcement learning...,1,78,20,1560088699,"[d] a few questions from a behavioral scientist on reinforcement learning... i've recently started getting interested in ai. as far as i know, from my friend who is more familiar with ai, in reinforcement learning only 2 concepts are applied: reinforcement (layman's term: reward), and punishment.

however, in behavioral science there are many more elements that may be useful to implement in an ai.

1. there are concepts such as discriminative stimuli, or stimulus generalization.
2. there are also other concepts such as continuous and discrete stimulus/response fields.
3. there are ""schedules of reinforcement"" which change the frequency of an organisms response (such as variable ratio, fixed ratio, variable interval, fixed interval)
4. etc.

i'm not familiar with any ai that uses these concepts and others from behavior analysis. is anyone familiar with any ai that tries to implement these?

it seems to me a concept such as stimulus generalization may be a useful step in artificial general intelligence for 'one shot learning' - to give an example from a study: if you reinforce a pigeon with food everytime it pecks a key under a 550 milimicron (color wavelength) light, then you stop reinforcement (giving it food if it pecks), and you change the color of the light slightly to 560 or 570, the pigeon still pecks the key but fewer times. therefore 'stimulus generalization' occurs. in other words, the pigeon responds similarly to similar stimuli (but with a reduced frequency). the more you change the color - to say 580, then 590, the less responses (or pecks on the key). this also occurs with punishment.

is anyone familiar with this being applied to ai? or anything additional from behavioral science for that matter? if only reinforcement and punishment are applied i fear that's really limiting the great potential of ai.",76,1767,11,282

1) building ml models in python is faster and easier

2) there's absolutely no use-case where you might need to train in c++

3) if performance is what you're after, why not train in python then export your model for inference in c++

4) if you insist on c++, why not use caffe, mxnet or pytorch

and my answers are the following:

1) it's easier if you're comfortable with python. personally, i hate python and i am never comfortable working with untyped languages. i may be old school but i have 15+ years of c++ experience and that makes it easier and faster for me.

2) here's a few use cases off the top of my head:
- using the library to perform tensor calculations on the gpu, for non machine-learning uses (such as audio dsps, ray tracing, etc...) while still benefitting from tf's optimizations and distributed graph computation capabilities
- training unsupervised ml models with data read from physical sensors in realtime
- training models that require some lengthy data preprocessing or postprocessing that need to be done on cpu
- online-training models on devices that are memory or battery constrained where having a python interpreter and a webserver to serve the inference model would be wasteful

3) see #2 there are many cases where this assumption doesn't hold

4) i tried mxnet for a year before eventually giving up. the library is so unstable and buggy it's barely usable. also tensorflow is truly remarkable when it comes to its distributed graph computation capabilities and seems to be the most evolved in terms of portability. it works across oss, gpus, tpus, different cpu arch, etc... not to mention the large community and active google support

with all that being said, i'm interested to know what everyone thinks. i plan on open-sourcing the wrapper eventually but that would require some extra work on my behalf, proper documentation and working examples, etc... i'd push that further if i know there's absolutely no interest in the project.

wasn't happy as a postdoc and decided to join the industry instead. 

joined a mid-level software company that developed analytics software for various businesses, hoping to  utilize my ml and stats knowledge, but quickly found that at the time (2009\~2010) domain knowledge and implementation expertise were much more valued than mathematical and modeling skills (again *at that time* \- things seems to have changed radically since then - i remember hearing more than once while interviewing in 2009 hiring managers say that they'd rather hire a domain expert and train them on the science than hire a scientist and train them on the domain).   

within a year, i switched to a tpm/architect type of role, going to client sites and doing implementations or assisting with project management and tech support, and worked for various consulting firms in that capacity, as there seemed to be more money and opportunity there. 

in a way, i was never that far removed from data science, since the products i was peddling always involved an analytics/predictive function. but none of the roles i had involved any explicit science work, other than having to explain to clients and business stake holders the math that was behind some of the algorithms used in the software i worked with. 

&#x200b;

then in 2014, i realized that ds and ml were fashionable, and that experience with neural networks (my old passion) was considered a hot skill on the market, so i decided to get back into data science. i started learning r and python (in my grad school days i was mostly a matlab person) and catching up on the latest developments in the field, frequenting kaggle discussions and other forums, leetcode, etc...

i thought the combination of business knowledge / consulting experience + ph.d level understanding of the models and math involved would make me a golden candidate for various ds/ml roles. 

&#x200b;

instead, over the last 5 years, i have found it very difficult to break into the field, with recruiters and hiring managers rarely paying attention to me, and when they do, i can't seem to get passed the technical screens or initial interviews because of my lack of real world experience with things like spark, flask, etc... and my mostly theoretical (very deep, but still purely theoretical) knowledge of how models other than time series and linear regression work. 

even more frustrating is that more and more people with less qualifications than me seem to transition at will into data science roles (business analyst or sde completes a coursera certificate in machine learning, gets promoted to data science role the next month). 

to top it all off: i'm nearing forty now (which i gather is ancient in machine learning years) and i feel like my chances of breaking into the filed based on age alone are decreasing exponentially every year.

&#x200b;

how would one go about validating the research in these papers with the lacking source code ? 

&#x200b;

for one re-constructing the model exactly as the original in some cases could be hard, since the paper might only mention the generic architecture for some block, but not the exact variation they went for.

&#x200b;

secondly, it seems it would be a rather tedious task to reverse engineer the model and the training code just to validate simple things about what the researchers did (e.g. that they didn't make some error in the sampling of train/test/validation data and as such got the wrong numbers in the paper for a specific dataset)

&#x200b;

do people just email the authors and ask for the source code ? thus keeping it constrained within the specific academic circles the author desire ? if so, why make the paper open to being with, since for a lot of them a pretty good replica of the model can be constructed from the paper alone.",75,1195,13,200

for those of you who are interested in rl, 

&#x200b;

i recently implemented basic rl algorithms such as 

reinforce, vanilla actor-critic, ddpg, a3c, dqn and ppo with pytorch.

&#x200b;

characteristics are as follows :

* each algorithm is complete within a single file.
* length of each algorithm is up to 100\~150 lines of codes.
* every algorithm can be trained within 30 seconds, even without gpu.
* envs are fixed to ""cartpole-v1"". you can just focus on the implementations.

&#x200b;

as you can see in the name of the repository, 

i tried to make the code as  brief and intuitive as possible.

hope you enjoy :)

thank you.

&#x200b;

![img](midd5z9v41z21)

 

the pretraining is using basic perceptual loss (or ""feature loss"") for the generator.  this gets you the benefits of gans, without the problems, basically. hence, smooth video!

the progression of training looks like this (sweet spot is at 1.4%, then it goes too far from there and gets weird with the orange skin):

anyway, that's the gist. you can read more in the links above (readme for github project also has good details on nogan). oh by the way, nogan also works on super resolution, and i suspect for most image to image tasks as well as perhaps even non-image tasks.

a **method for training artificial neural networks** to generate missing data within a variable context. as the idea is hard to put in a single sentence, i will use an example:

an image may have missing pixels (let's say, under a smudge). how can one restore the missing pixels, knowing only the surrounding pixels? one approach would be a ""generator"" neural network that, given the surrounding pixels as input, generates the missing pixels.

but how to train such a network? one can't expect the network to exactly produce the missing pixels. imagine, for example, that the missing data is a patch of grass. one could teach the network with a bunch of images of lawns, with portions removed. the teacher knows the data that is missing, and could score the network according to the root mean square difference (rmsd) between the generated patch of grass and the original data. the problem is that if the generator encounters an image that is not part of the training set, it would be impossible for the neural network to put all the leaves, especially in the middle of the patch, in exactly the right places. the lowest rmsd error would probably be achieved by the network filling the middle area of the patch with a solid color that is the average of the color of pixels in typical images of grass. if the network tried to generate grass that looks convincing to a human and as such fulfills its purpose, there would be an unfortunate penalty by the rmsd metric.

my idea is this (see figure below): train simultaneously with the generator a classifier network that is given, in random or alternating sequence, generated and original data. the classifier then has to guess, in the context of the surrounding image context, whether the input is original (1) or generated (0). the generator network is simultaneously trying to get a high score (1) from the classifier. the outcome, hopefully, is that both networks start out really simple, and progress towards generating and recognizing more and more advanced features, approaching and possibly defeating human's ability to discern between the generated data and the original. if multiple training samples are considered for each score, then rmsd is the correct error metric to use, as this will encourage the classifier network to output probabilities.",31,2490,6,385

for the last 2 years i really got into ml, taking classes on my free time (learning from data, reading deep learning book and other ml books, and now the david silver rl class). and i found it so interesting that i want to spend more time on it and do research.
given how competitive phd applications are, do i stand any chances, since my background is not pure engineering? if yes, any advices on how to start?

1,"[D] Training on the cloud: GCP GPU pricing seems dramatically cheaper, why would you train on AWS or Azure?",1,17,20,1557597226,"[d] training on the cloud: gcp gpu pricing seems dramatically cheaper, why would you train on aws or azure? like the title says, looking at the cost of entry-level gpu instances on the major clouds:

aws: p2.xlarge -- 1 tesla k80, 4 vcpus, 61gb ram **$0.900/hr**
azure: nc6 -- 1 tesla k80, 6 vcpus, 56gb ram **$0.900/hr**
gcp: 1 tesla k80, 6 vcpus, 52gb ram **$0.663/hr**

further, for training cnns on the k80 i never exceed 4-5gb of memory usage or reasonable utilization of 4 vcpus. since gcp is the only cloud that gives me ability to finely tune specs i can even further decrease cost for ml applications. for example:

gcp: 1 tesla k80, 4 vcpus, 5gb ram **$0.424/hr**

when benchmarking resnet50, this cheaper configuration provides no performance decrease compared to the more expensive instance.

perhaps spot instance pricing (low-priority for azure, preemptible for gcp) comes into play, where gcp is in the middle of the pack:

aws: p2.xlarge -- 1 tesla k80, 4 vcpus, 61gb ram **$0.270/hr**
azure: nc6 -- 1 tesla k80, 6 vcpus, 56gb ram **$0.180/hr**
gcp: 1 tesla k80, 6 vcpus, 52gb ram **$0.236/hr**

this kind of instance, however, does not work for every use case so the regular on-demand pricing difference is still significant.

this all leaves me wondering:
if you train your models on the cloud, which provider do you use?

can you imagine any reasons/use cases/etc that might warrant picking a provider other than gcp?

what is gcps business model? how can they make money selling for so much less? is this a loss leader to gain market share?",107,1452,19,233

tl;dr: we show that adversarial examples aren't really weird aberrations or random artifacts, and are instead actually meaningful but imperceptible features of the data distribution (i.e. they are helpful for generalization). we prove this through a series of experiments that shows that (a) you can learn just based on these imperceptible features embedded into a completely mislabeled training set and generalize to the true test set (b) you can remove these imperceptible features and generalize \*robustly\* to the true test set (with standard training).

1,[D] Neural Networks Without Bias Terms Are Brightness Invariant,1,38,22,1557121881,"[d] neural networks without bias terms are brightness invariant what do matrix multiplication, relu, and max pooling all have in common?  yes their [second derivatives are all zero](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning/comments/aqfl70/d_neural_networks_with_second_derivative_zero_ae/), but there is another interesting property that they all satisfy:

    f(a x) = a f(x)

which means that, when you stack these on top of each other, scaling the input of the network by some constant is equivalent to scaling the output by some constant.  moreover, there are cases where the scale of the output doesn't matter (e.g. if predicted classes are based on argmax of the network output).

this leaves us in an interesting situation where it's actually very easy to encode complete brightness invariance in a network -- where you can always brighten/darken an image by some factor without affecting its predictions (assuming you normalize the scale of the output in some way -- softmax, sphere projection, etc.).

i've trained models with and without biases on cifar and find they're both reasonable.  i suspect a more rigorous comparision would find that networks without bias terms tend to do marginally worse than models with them -- if only because they have more parameters (e.g. without bias terms you can't learn that airplane images are usually brighter than frog images).

but in the interest of developing networks that actually generalize well to the real world (not just the random sample of your data you held out as a test set) it seems like this a modest performance gap might be permissible, if it means you can be confident that your network will work well in significantly different lighting conditions.",63,1654,9,260

the determining factors for the results of training a model or other activities include the following:

* training data — the image database or whatever data source is used in training the model
* the scripts used in training the model
* the libraries used by the training scripts
* the scripts used in processing data
* the libraries or other tools used in processing data
* the operating system and cpu/gpu hardware

obviously the result of training a model depends on a variety of conditions. since there are so many variables to this, it is hard to be precise, but the general problem is a lack of what’s now called configuration management.

version control saves our life because it gives us control over the mighty powers of coding. we can easily see changes and focus on whats important.

until now, those two worlds were separate. there were some trials to merge the two worlds but none of the projects really felt seamless. the developer experience just was not great.

# introducing jupytext:

[https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext)

jupytext saves two (synced) versions of your notebook. a .ipynb file and a .py file. (other formats are possible as well.) you check the .py file into your git repo and **track your changes** but you work in the jupyter notebook and **make your changes** there. (if you need some fancy editor commands like refactoring or multicursor, you can just edit the .py file with pycharm, save the file, refresh your notebook and keep working).

also, the creator and maintainer, **marc is really helpful** and kind and he works really long to make jupytext work for the community. **please try out jupytext** and show him some love via **starring his github repo**.

q(z|x) = n(u(x),cov(x))
where cov(x) is a diagonal matrix.
 
this means that we are inherently generating latents that will be independent given an input image x. so why does increase learning pressure on the kl divergence term between posterior and gaussian prior should help any more in learning independent latents when posterior is already assumed to be independent?",87,663,10,95
1,[D] Masters to Industry - Learnings,1,221,47,1556391588,"[d] masters to industry - learnings as a recent master's grad that just entered into the ml/robotics industry, i'm drafting all the observations and lessons i learned throughout this journey. i hope that anyone else reading this doesn't repeat my mistakes.

note: this might not be applicable to everyone, for obvious reasons.

a little bit about me - a recent master's grad with almost non-existent industry experience, apart from one summer internship with my advisor at a robotics company she worked for (i did not end up there). my undergrad was in something different altogether and shifted to cv/ml/dl over the past 2 years. i graduated from a top 5 university in robotics/ml. i took few but highly impactful classes throughout my masters and focussed more on research. i did not publish anything but plan to soon. i was always fascinated about autonomous vehicles and am now working at a promising mid-sized company.

firstly, there is an extreme dearth of good research engineers and companies are willing to shell out a butt-load of money and stocks to lure you in.

resume - i had put github hyperlinks to my project code (github) and reports (gdrive) which surprisingly caught a lot of traction. when interviewing for the company i work for now, the interviewers took the time to read through a project report i had done last year (i made it a point to read through all my reports before any interview), grilled me on it for one hour and it was the most fun interview i ever had.

midway through all the interviews, i started tracking each application through an app like trello. by 'tracking' i mean every single technical or coding question asked, how did i answer or approach it and what could have been done better. it goes without saying that the initial interviews were horrible. having an answer within 5 sec of the question is not what i was conditioned for. i tend to think for a long time (15-20 sec) before i can spew out an answer. however, by tracking each application, i observed that all companies would pretty much ask the same technical questions and before each interview going over that question bank got me through some rounds that i would have otherwise never been able to crack. the link is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whkndyxtsfvinrzoimvqkekgxgn1z51izktd4r8dcai/edit?usp=sharing). feel free to add more questions that you've come across.

the dreaded coding rounds - at first, they were daunting! speaking your mind while you try to come up with a working logic, code and test it in 45-60 min is not humanly possible without a ton a practice. that said, my confidence did grow with time and i noticed that almost every question asked was from the easy and medium collection from [this question bank](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/). i had to go through all the questions in that collection *twice* before i could muster this round. if you're interested in the autonomous driving or robotics industry, c++ skills and knowledge is an extreme necessity. the c++ modules in geeksforgeeks.com was a life-saver. specifically, you should be able to understand and incorporate in your code - templates, inheritance, pointers, references, std::vector, std::unordered\_map, std::move, std::undordered\_set, constructor, destructors, virtual functions and have an understanding of how they work behind the scenes. again, all coding questions are listed in the same doc as the technical questions one (above).

my unemployed friends and i practiced a few coding rounds amongst ourselves. that helped.

write pseudo-code before diving into code! i like the pseudo-code to be fairly detailed but that's up to you. even though you might not be able to finish coding the solution in time, the interviewer has some data points to look at and also makes sure you and the interviewer are on the same page.

some other points to consider- towards the end of the interview, ask meaningful questions. what do they work on, what challenges are they facing currently, how did they tackle a previous challenge, etc.

after the interview, please make sure to send a thank you mail to all your interviewers. it goes a long way.

as always, if you have any questions, i'd be glad to answer",35,4217,6,677

1,[R] Speech synthesis from neural decoding of spoken sentences (Nature),1,162,17,1556171906,"[r] speech synthesis from neural decoding of spoken sentences (nature) **speech synthesis from neural decoding of spoken sentences**

technology that translates neural activity into speech would be transformative for people who are unable to communicate as a result of neurological impairments. decoding speech from neural activity is challenging because speaking requires very precise and rapid multi-dimensional control of vocal tract articulators. here we designed a neural decoder that explicitly leverages kinematic and sound representations encoded in human cortical activity to synthesize audible speech. recurrent neural networks first decoded directly recorded cortical activity into representations of articulatory movement, and then transformed these representations into speech acoustics. in closed vocabulary tests, listeners could readily identify and transcribe speech synthesized from cortical activity. intermediate articulatory dynamics enhanced performance even with limited data. decoded articulatory representations were highly conserved across speakers, enabling a component of the decoder to be transferrable across participants. furthermore, the decoder could synthesize speech when a participant silently mimed sentences. these findings advance the clinical viability of using speech neuroprosthetic technology to restore spoken communication.

i've had some research-y internships in industry but i think a ""research engineer""-type role would be best for me, (and it's also much more common than research scientist positions in areas i'm interested in such as autonomy and robotics).  however, those roles generally ask for someone who is equally well-versed in statistical machine learning theory, deep learning and python (check) and software development in c/c++ (something i need to work on).  research code is almost exclusively in python (aside from the ocassional cuda kernel for a novel layer) so essentially no one i know does development in c++ aside from side projects.

in the video, we tested an object detection live stream under the following conditions:

\- a pretrained mobilenet v2 model, trained on the common objects in context (coco) dataset 

\- a bounding boxes threshold of 45% confidence because there were way too many boxes displayed in the default configuration

\- a camera connected via usb, not the official camera from coral

&#x200b;

there is a lot of buzz around tensorflow 2.0 with tons of blog posts and tutorial. but i haven't found a complete example that uses all the latest features and best practices brought by tf2. this project is created with the goal of being clean, efficient and complete with zero legacy debts.

&#x200b;

some of the key features include:

* everything is tensorflow 2.0, no more `session.run` or `import keras.backend as k`
* pure functional model definition compatible with both eager and graph execution
* eager mode custom training loop with `tf.gradienttape` (very good for debugging)
* graph mode high performance training with `model.fit(dataset)`
* training pipeline uses [`tf.data`](https://tf.data) and `tfrecord` for optimal throughput
* input transformations are implemented using the `@tf.function` auto-graph feature
* almost all tensor manipulations are vectorized to squeeze out that last bit of efficiency
* works with gpu out of box (tf2's gpu integration is miles ahead of pytorch's `if gpu: x.cuda()`)
* fully integrated with `absl-py`. tensorflow 2.0 is deprecating `tf.flags` and recommends abseil (great library, heavily used by google)
* i haven't gotten chance to test multi-gpu or distributed setup, but they are supposedly very easy to do with tf2.0.

&#x200b;

the yolov3 implementation is mostly referenced from the [origin paper](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/yolov3.pdf), original [darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) with inspirations from many existing code written in pytorch, keras and tf1 (i credited them at the end of the readme). i tried to fixed all the inconsistency, incompleteness and minor errors existing in other repos here. the project works with both yolov3 and yolov3-tiny and is compatible with pre-trained darknet weights.

my question is, how can we understand that chicken is something related to cafe or supermarket, but not related to locksmith or post office.

more specifically, i have n number of point of interest types and i am trying to come up with n probabilities p_1, p_2, ..., p_n where each probability represents the likelihood (or meaningfulness) of string-type pairs.

my ultimate goal is to have an unequality containing these n probabilities, which should of course be meaningful

i want to have

p(chicken, synagogue) < p(chicken, supermarket)

but not

p(chicken, train_station) > p(chicken, café)

i have tried to do google searches and determine these probabilities according to the number of results but it wasn't satisfying at all.

for example, when i searched ""chicken breast embassy"": i got 24,500,000 results. for ""chicken breast supermarket"", number of results was 11,600,000.

if we compute the probabilities by only taking these numbers into account, we'd arrive at a conclusion where p(chicken, supermarket) < p(chicken, embassy) which would of course be wrong.

vlog version as usual:

[https://youtu.be/dcngi6x-yk0](https://youtu.be/dcngi6x-yk0)

today (and yesterday) i did & learned:

rl seems to have a lot of exploration going on vs some other ml tasks. one popular application it has is definitely beating videogames. the [mario ai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6uvoq0f44&t=1s) was a viral hit in 2015. i decided to build a rl model that can beat atari breakout. this was soon classified as impossible given my current coding skills, so i chose to implement a [medium article](https://becominghuman.ai/lets-build-an-atari-ai-part-0-intro-to-rl-9b2c5336e0ec) first that beat atari breakout. this article was great at linking the original atari breakout rl paper with the code, but the full code was not posted, so i was stuck. luckily, a user named boyuanf hit us up with the tensorflow implementation of the article on medium, here's the forked version of [it](https://github.com/blastwind/deepqlearning). 

i downloaded the trained weights and model, and i ran it after installing openai gym in conda with pip. unfortunately, atari-py seems incompatible with windows 10, so i had to go through a very annoying process to finally come through with this easy line of code to solve the problem: 

    pip install --no-index -f https://github.com/kojoley/atari-py/releases atari_py

yea it is just one of those problems man. 

anyways, i then was able to run **gym** and see the beautiful pre-trained model doing work, it got to a pretty good high score, i think 57 or something. 

it is actually **after i implemented the project that i come back to reading the papers**, this works for me. i usually try to guess what the original algorithm does by doing a project first. for me, doing a project first then reading the paper also gives that revelation of: ""oh, the reason that i have this line in the code is because of that sentence in the paper"".

the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) and this [medium article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/diving-deeper-into-reinforcement-learning-with-q-learning-c18d0db58efe) helped my understanding a lot. this pseudocode in the paper opened the doors for me: 

&#x200b;

https://i.redd.it/6bpl6f203yr21.png

i'm going to try to explain this pseudocode with even english-er language. we will input the current frame and a few previous frames to our rl model. the rl model will interpret these inputs as the **state**, and it will either choose the **action** based on the **q-table** or choose a random action. we can imagine that as the model gets more advanced, we will choose less random actions to let the model learn, but in the early stages, when the model has no idea what to do, we probably want to let it explore randomly, we will use a decreasing **epsilon** value to model this. the emulator will receive the action chosen by the rl model, run that action, then display the new image and return the reward. the **q-table** will be updated based on this reward. the **q-table** is just a table that has states mapping to potential actions. when the model is complex and epsilon is low, the rl model chooses actions based on the **q-table,** a higher value (which means high rewards) in the state mapping to action will probably mean the model is choosing that. 

that;s it for this one, i learned a lot since it was my first time exploring rl! exciting, can't wait to do more.",110,3477,16,541

it is *very* heavily based on [ikostrikov's wonderful pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail). you could even consider this a port. the api and underlying algorithms are almost identical (with the necessary changes involved in the move to c++).

it also contains a reimplementation simple openai gym server that communicates via [zeromq](http://zeromq.org/) to test the framework on gym environments.

cpprl aims to be an extensible, reasonably optimized, production-ready framework for using reinforcement learning in projects where python isn't viable. it should be ready to use in desktop applications on user's computers with minimal setup required on the user's side.

## motivation

at the time of writing, there are no general-use reinforcement learning frameworks for c++. i needed one for a personal project, and the pytorch c++ frontend had recently been released, so i figured i should make one.

## features

* implemented algorithms:
   * a2c
   * ppo
* recurrent policies (gru based)
* cross-platform compatibility (tested on windows 10, ubuntu 16.04, and ubuntu 18.04)
* solid test coverage
* decently optimized (always open to pull requests improving optimization though)

there is a belief that the number of saddles is exp(dim) larger than of minima. actively repelling them (instead of attracting) requires control of sign of curvatures (as hessian eigenvalues) - e.g. switching step sign in these directions.

it is e.g. done in **saddle-free newton method (sfn)** ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2572 ) - 2014, 600+ citations, [recent github](https://github.com/dave-fernandes/saddlefreeoptimizer). they claim to get a few times(!) lower error e.g. on mnist this way, other methods stagnated on some plateaus with strong negative eigenvalues: https://i.imgur.com/xjlbggl.png

here is a very interesting recent paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02366 investigating evolution of eigenvalues of hessian for 3.3m parameters (~20 terabytes!), for example showing that rare negative curvature directions allow for relatively large improvements: https://i.imgur.com/swuasvc.png

so it looks great - it seems that we all should use sfn or other methods actively repelling saddles ... but it didn't happen - why is it so?

what are other promising 2nd order approaches repelling saddles?

how can we improve sfn-like methods? for example what i mostly don't like is directly estimating hessian from noisy data, what is very problematic numerically. instead, we are really interested in linear behavior of 1st derivative - we can optimally estimate it with [\(online\) linear regression of gradients](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11457) ...",114,1932,15,259

1,[D] A primer on TensorFlow 2.0,1,74,38,1554834934,"[d] a primer on tensorflow 2.0 i've noticed some confusion on what tensorflow 2.0 is on this subreddit. i worked as an engineer on parts of tensorflow 2.0, specifically on imperative (or ""eager"") execution. i'll try to clear up some of the confusion here. i'm also happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability.

(i'm no longer employed by alphabet / google brain, so these words are my own.)

tf 2.0 is a backwards-incompatible update to tf's (1) execution model and (2) api. it is currently in [alpha](https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha).

(1) tf 2.0 executes operations imperatively (or ""eagerly"") by default; this means that it will feel similar to pytorch or numpy. it also provides a just-in-time tracer (`tf.function`) that rewrites python functions that execute tf (2.0) operations into graphs. this tracer also rewrites python asts to replace tensor-dependent python control flow to tf control flow using [autograph](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/autograph), meaning that you don't need to use constructs like `tf.cond` or `tf.while_loop`. using this tracer is optional. the tracer is similar in spirit to `torch.jit.trace` and `torchscript`, but the usage and semantics are different. it's also similar to [jax's `jit`](https://github.com/google/jax).

one consequence of this change is that in 2.0, there's no global graph, no global collections, no `get_variable`, no `custom_getter`s, no `session`, no feeds, no fetches, no `placeholder`s, no `control_dependencies`, no variable initializers, etc., even when you're using `tf.function`. there are many other things that have been excised from the api. 

(2)  in tf 1.x, there were many high-level apis for neural networks (e.g., see everything under `tf.contrib`, which no longer exists in 2.0). many users found this confusing, especially because these apis were similar but different and incompatible. with 2.0, tf has standardized on `tf.keras`, which is essentially an implementation of the keras api specification, customized for tf's need.

that said, tf 2.0 has many [low-level apis](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf), for things like numerical computation (`tf`, `tf.math`), linear algebra (`tf.linalg`), automatic differentiation (`tf.gradienttape`), state (`tf.variable`), neural networks (`tf.nn`), stochastic gradient-based optimization (`tf.optimizers`, `tf.losses`), dataset munging (`tf.data`). i've only named a few of these low-level apis. if you don't want to use `tf.keras`, you're free to use these low-level apis directly. note that you can also directly use the object oriented layers in `tf.keras.layers` without wrapping them in `tf.keras.sequential` or `tf.keras.model`.

i've written a more comprehensive, technical primer on tf 2.0, which is available as a [blog post](https://www.debugmind.com/2019/04/07/a-primer-on-tensorflow-2-0/) and as a [python notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gekd_d-b8y0quxdz-oojl_sfwghp5lsr). there's also an [official guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/effective_tf2) from the tf team.",30,3066,6,396

* **pyts ([github](https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts), [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyts/), [readthedocs](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)): a python package for time series transformation and classification.**
* **it aims to make time series classification easily accessible by providing preprocessing and utility tools, and implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms.**
* **[pyts-repro](https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts-repro): comparaison with the results published in the literature.**


## motivations

almost two years ago, i was an intern at a company and a colleague was working on a time series classification task. it was my end-of-studies internship and i had been studying machine learning for one year only (my background studies were more focused on statistics). i realized that i had no knowledge about machine learning for time series besides sarima and all the models with fewer letters. i also had limited knowledge about computer science. i did some literature search about time series classification and discovered a lot of things that i had never heard of before. thus, i decided to start a project with the following motivations:
* create a python package through a github repository (because i had no idea how both worked);
* look at the source code of python packages that i used regurlaly (numpy, scikit-learn) to gain knowledge;
* implement algorithms about time series classification.

## development and what i learnt

before implementing anything, i had to :
* learn how to package a python project,
* do a more advanced literature search about time series classification,
* think about the structure of the package.

when i had an overall first idea of what i wanted to do, i could start coding. during this process, i discovered a lot of tools that were already available and that i had re-implemented myself less efficiently ([numpy.digitize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html), [sklearn.utils.check_array](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.check_array.html), [numpy.put](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.put.html), and [numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided.html) come to my mind). the following process could pretty much sum up the history of this project:
1. try to implement a new algorithm;
2. in doing so, find tools that do what i wanted more efficiently, not necessarly related to the new algorithm;
3. implement the algorithm and edit the relevant code with the newly discovered tools.

two major *discoveries* had a huge impact on the development of this project: [scikit-learn-contrib/project-template](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template) and [numba](https://github.com/numba/numba). the former made me discover a lot of concepts that i did not know about (tests, code coverage, continuous integration, documentation) and provides ready-to-use scripts. the latter made optimizing code much easier as i was very confused about cython and building wheels, and deciced not to use cython. i also discovered the notion of *proper code* (pep8, pep257, etc.), and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) recently. this might be obvious for most people, but i did not know any of these concepts at the time.


## what this package provides

the current version of pyts consists of the following modules:

- `approximation`: this module provides implementations of algorithms that
approximate time series. implemented algorithms are
[piecewise aggregate approximation](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.approximation.piecewiseaggregateapproximation.html#),
[symbolic aggregate approximation](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.approximation.symbolicaggregateapproximation.html#),
[discrete fourier transform](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.approximation.discretefouriertransform.html#),
[multiple coefficient binning](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.approximation.multiplecoefficientbinning.html#) and
[symbolic fourier approximation](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.approximation.symbolicfourierapproximation.html#).

- `bag_of_words`: this module consists of a class
[bagofwords](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.bag_of_words.bagofwords.html#)
that transforms time series into bags of words. this approach is quite common
in time series classification.

- `classification`: this module provides implementations of algorithms that
can classify time series. implemented algorithms are
[kneighborsclassifier](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.classification.kneighborsclassifier.html#),
[saxvsm](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.classification.saxvsm.html#) and
[bossvs](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.classification.bossvs.html#).

- `decomposition`: this module provides implementations of algorithms that
decompose a time series into several time series. the only implemented algorithm
is
[singular spectrum analysis](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.decomposition.singularspectrumanalysis.html#).

- `image`: this module provides implementations of algorithms that transform
time series into images. implemented algorithms are
[recurrence plot](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.image.recurrenceplot.html#),
[gramian angular field](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.image.gramianangularfield.html#) and
[markov transition field](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.image.markovtransitionfield.html#).

- `metrics`: this module provides implementations of metrics that are specific
to time series. implemented metrics are
[dynamic time warping](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.metrics.dtw.html#)
with several variants and the
[boss](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.metrics.boss.html#)
metric.

- `preprocessing`: this module provides most of the scikit-learn preprocessing
tools but applied sample-wise (i.e. to each time series independently) instead
of feature-wise, as well as an
[imputer](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.preprocessing.interpolationimputer.html#)
of missing values using interpolation. more information is available at the
[pyts.preprocessing api documentation](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#module-pyts.preprocessing).

- `transformation`: this module provides implementations of algorithms that
transform a data set of time series with shape `(n_samples, n_timestamps)` into
a data set with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`. implemented algorithms are
[boss](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.transformation.boss.html#) and
[weasel](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pyts.transformation.weasel.html#).

- `utils`: a simple module with
[utility functions](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#module-pyts.utils).

i also wanted to have an idea about how my implementations perform compared to the performance reported in the papers and on the [time series classification repository](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com). the point is to see if my implementations are reliable or not. to do so, i created a [github repository](https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts-repro) where i make these comparisons on the smallest datasets. i think that my implementation of weasel might be under-performing, but for the other implementations reported the performance is comparable. there are sometimes intentional differences between my implementation and the description of the algorithm in the paper, which might explain the differences in performance.


## future work

the main reason of this post is to get feedback. i have been pretty much working on my own on this project, doing what i felt like doing. however, as a phd student, i know how important it is to get feedback on your work. so, if you have any feedback on how i could improve the package, it would be really appreciated. nonetheless, i still have ideas of future work:
* add a `dataset` module: i think that it is an important missing tool of the package. right now i create a dumb toy dataset in all the [examples in the documentation](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html). adding a couple of datasets in the package directly (i would obviously need to contact authors to get permission to do so) like the iris dataset in scikit-learn would make the examples more relevant in my opinion. adding a function to download datasets from the [time series classification repository](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com) (similarly to [sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml.html) or [sklearn.datasets.fetch_mldata](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_mldata.html)) would be quite useful too. being able to generate a toy dataset like [sklearn.datasets.make_classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html) would be a nice addition. if you have any idea about generating a classification dataset for time series, with any number of classes and any number of timestamps, feel free to comment, i would be really interested. right now i only know the cylinder-bell-funnel dataset, but it is quite limiting (128 timestamps and 3 classes).
* add a `multivariate` module. currently the package provides no tools to deal with multivariate time series. like binary classifiers that need extending for multiclass classification, adding a voting classifier (with a classifier for each feature of the multivariate time series) would be useful, as well as specific algorithms for multivariate time series.
* make the package available on anacloud cloud through the `conda-forge` channel. `conda` seems to be quite popular thanks to the utilities it provides and making the package installable with `conda` could be a plus.
* update the required versions of the dependencies: currently the required versions of the dependencies are the versions that i use on my computer. i'm quite confident that older versions for some packages could work, but i have no idea how to determine them (i exclude doing a backward gridsearch until continuous integreation fails). are there any tools that can try to guess the minimum versions of the packages, by looking at what functions are used from each package for instance?
* implement more algorithms: time series bag-of-features, shapelet-based algorithms, etc. a lot of algorithms are not available in the package currently. adding more metrics specific to time series would also be great.


## acknowledgements

looking back at the history of this project, i realize how much i learnt thanks to the scientific python community: there are so many open source well-documented tools that are made available, it is pretty amazing.

i would also like to thank the authors of papers that i contacted in order to get more information about the algorithms that they presented. i always received quick, kind answers. special thanks to patrick schäfer, who received a lot of emails from me and always replied.

i would like to thank all the people involved in the [time series classification repository](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com). it is an awesome tool with datasets freely available and reported results for each algorithm.

finally, i would like to thank every contributor to the project, as well as people helping making this package better through opening issues or sending me emails.


## conclusion

working on this project has been a blast. sometimes learning takes a lot of time, and i experienced it quite often, but i think that it is worth it. i work on this project on my spare time, so i cannot spend as much time as much as i would like, but i think that it gets slowly but steadily better. there are still a lot of things that are a bit confusing to me (all the configuration files for ci and documentation, managing a git repository with several branches and several contributors), and seeing room for improvement is also an exciting part of this experience.

there was a [post about machine learning on time series](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning/comments/9ofd7x/d_machine_learning_on_time_series_data/) on this subreddit several months ago. if you were interested in what was discussed in this post (and more specially in the top comment), you might be interested in pyts.

thank you very much for reaching the end of this long post. if you have some time to give me any feedback, it would mean a lot to me. have a very nice day!",76,12964,11,1493

now, i am admittedly something of a relative beginner when it comes to ml and tf especially so maybe i don't understand the nuances, but i would have thought that tf 2.0 would have changed the entire api to be more like that of keras or pytorch instead of just changing the docs to tell me to use tf.keras. am i actually just using keras with the ability to do more advanced things or is it still tensorflow?

google told vox on thursday that it’s pulling the plug on the ethics board.

the board survived for barely more than one week. founded to guide “responsible development of ai” at google, it would have had eight members and met four times over the course of 2019 to consider concerns about google’s ai program. those concerns include how ai can enable authoritarian states, how ai algorithms produce disparate outcomes, whether to work on military applications of ai, and more. but it ran into problems from the start.

thousands of google employees signed a petition calling for the removal of one board member, heritage foundation president kay coles james, over her comments about trans people and her organization’s skepticism of climate change. meanwhile, the inclusion of drone company ceo dyan gibbens reopened old divisions in the company over the use of the company’s ai for military applications.

board member alessandro acquisti resigned. another member, joanna bryson, defending her decision not to resign, claimed of james, “believe it or not, i know worse about one of the other people.” other board members found themselves swamped with demands that they justify their decision to remain on the board.

one of google’s top a.i. people just joined apple

- ian goodfellow joined apple’s special projects group as a director of machine learning last month.

- prior to google, he worked at openai, an ai research consortium originally funded by elon musk and other tech notables.

- he is the father of an ai approach known as general adversarial networks, or gans, and his research is widely cited in ai literature.

ian goodfellow, one of the top minds in artificial intelligence at google, has joined apple in a director role.

the hire comes as apple increasingly strives to tap ai to boost its software and hardware. last year apple hired john giannandrea, head of ai and search at google, to supervise ai strategy.


goodfellow updated his linkedin profile on thursday to acknowledge that he moved from google to apple in march. he said he’s a director of machine learning in the special projects group. in addition to developing ai for features like faceid and siri, apple also has been working on autonomous driving technology. recently the autonomous group had a round of layoffs.

a google spokesperson confirmed his departure. apple declined to comment. goodfellow didn’t respond to a request for comment.

**tl;dr**

- *best gpu overall*: rtx 2070

- *gpus to avoid*: any tesla card; any quadro card; any founders edition card; titan rtx, titan v, titan xp

- *cost-efficient but expensive*: rtx 2070

- *cost-efficient and cheap*:  rtx 2060, gtx 1060 (6gb).

- *i have little money*: gtx 1060 (6gb)

- *i have almost no money*: gtx 1050 ti (4gb).alternatively: cpu (prototyping) + aws/tpu (training); or colab.

- *i do kaggle*: rtx 2070. if you do not have enough money go for a gtx 1060 (6gb) or gtx titan (pascal) from ebay for prototyping and aws for final training. use fastai library.

- *i am a competitive computer vision or machine translation researcher*: gtx 2080 ti with the blower fan design. if you train very large networks get rtx titans.

- *i am an nlp researcher*: rtx 2080 ti use 16-bit.
i want to build a gpu cluster: this is really complicated, you can get some ideas from my multi-gpu blog post.

- *i started deep learning and i am serious about it*: start with an rtx 2070. buy more rtx 2070 after 6-9 months and you still want to invest more time into deep learning. depending on what area you choose next (startup, kaggle, research, applied deep learning) sell your gpu and buy something more appropriate after about two years.

- *i want to try deep learning, but i am not serious about it*: gtx 1050 ti (4 or 2gb). this often fits into your standard desktop and does not require a new psu. if it fits, do not buy a new computer!

from the blog post:

today i am happy to announce our intention to make available the topical chat dataset, a corpus of human-human social conversations collected from crowd workers that will be released publicly on september 17, 2019.

the dataset was developed for teams competing in the alexa prize socialbot grand challenge 3, with the application period closing may 14, 2019, and the competition launching september 9, 2019 (apply and learn more here). teams competing in the alexa prize will have access to an expanded version of this dataset (the extended topical chat dataset) which includes the results of on-going collections and annotations, in addition to the many other resources exclusive to alexa prize participants.

the topical chat dataset will consist of more than 210,000 utterances (over 4,100,000 words), making it the largest social conversation and knowledge dataset available publicly to the research community, supporting the publication of high quality, repeatable research.

each conversation (and each turn of the conversation) in this dataset is linked to knowledge provided to crowd workers. the knowledge is collected from a variety of unstructured or loosely structured text resources, and each conversation refers to a related set of entities. none of these conversations are interactions with alexa customers. 

the goal of this collection is to enable the next steps of research in knowledge-grounded neural response generation systems, tackling hard challenges in natural conversation that are not addressed by other publicly available datasets. this will allow researchers to focus on the way humans transition between topics, knowledge-selection and enrichment, and integration of fact and opinion into dialogue.

1,[D]How to explain random forest models to business?,1,20,31,1554081251,"[d]how to explain random forest models to business? we recently built a random forest regressor to replace our previous regression model in one of our application. while the result shows a big improvement, our business client asked us to explain the model and visualize it.

&#x200b;

so we started with relative importance, pretty much like in the [relative importance of iris data](https://i0.wp.com/blog.methodsconsultants.com/posts/2018-06-13-be-aware-of-bias-in-rf-variable-importance-metrics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png?zoom=1.25&w=450&ssl=1)

&#x200b;

then we try to visualize the tree, also like the [random forest tree visualization of iris data](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*iplwmh-tjrhewxw7uaetmw.png) (full article:  [https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-visualize-a-decision-tree-from-a-random-forest-in-python-using-scikit-learn-38ad2d75f21c](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-visualize-a-decision-tree-from-a-random-forest-in-python-using-scikit-learn-38ad2d75f21c)), which put client in an immediate loss, to the point that while client was still impressed with the result and would like to give it a try, they were less certain to back the story. and it immediately lead to two things: 

1. is the model scalable to handle all scenarios?
2. would the model be still valid after a period of time? do we need to calibrate the model from time to time and what does that lead to business implications, e.g. how do we explain why we predicted result a in ver 1 and then result b in ver 2?

&#x200b;

this is just random forest and we want to bring others like neural networks into real use. how should we convince our clients in the right way?",51,1861,8,207

i tried to reproduce and summarize the results of original paper, making it a little easier to familiarize yourself with the idea. as i believe, this new architecture may soon be, among convolutional and recurrent networks, in a toolbox of any data scientist.

the code is my own implementation of the **neural ode**. i did it solely for better understanding of what's going on. however it is very close to what is actually implemented in authors' [repository](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq). this notebook collects all the code that's necessary for understanding in one place and is slightly more commented. for actual usage and experiments i suggest using authors' original implementation.

suppose i have some one-dimensional time-series data (for instance, continuous temperature measurements). the patterns in these data can be efficiently extracted by a covnet. if i have multiple instances of the same data set, say the raw data, low-pass filtered data, and high-pass filtered data, i could stack them into channels and feed this stack into the covnet (similar to having rgb images as input). but what happens if there is an offset in the different channels? or what if a channel exists in a different domain entirely (e.g. taking the fourier transform of the data)? can a covnet still do its job, or will it get confused by the misalignment or incompatibility of the different channels?",80,879,14,146

**<background & problem>**

i'm 28 years old canadian with bachelors in computer engineering (cgpa: 3.45/4.0) and masters in electrical engineering (cgpa: 3.58/4.0). my masters thesis was about video stitching. i wanted to work to on ai/ml since 25 but it was after i graduated from the undergrad, and vido stitching project was the only place i got accepted so i had no choice. i feel so burned out after years of trying to learn knowledge required for my masters thesis trying to understand trend and sota methods in ai/ml (to prepare phd applications). thus, new discoveres doesn't excite me as much as before.

&#x200b;

my gf is 27. since we had long-distance relationship (ldr) during my masters, she doesn't want to do ldr anymore. also, her moving to another city is out of option.

&#x200b;

**<career goals>**

my long term goal is to understand the computational aspect of what makes our brain so intelligent and reverse engineer it to design smarter ai. this is what i want to do during my phd. regarding getting a job, my goal is to work on machine learning related job.

&#x200b;

**<options>**

i think i have two options. feel free to discuss other alternatives i should consider as well.

&#x200b;

option 1: try working few years to gain real world experience

pros:

* hands on experience on real-world problem
* money
* may find the passion back
* no more long distance

cons:

* may not be able to apply phd later due to my age and new responsibilities
* may not be able to work on problems related to my long term goal

&#x200b;

option 2: apply phd again

pros:

* closely aligns with the long term goal
* able to apply jobs requires phd degree

&#x200b;

cons:

* not able to save any money before graduation
* must break up with gf if i didn't get into local phd program (only 2 schools)

*for some this analogy is merely a useful rhetorical device; for others it is a serious idea. but the brain isn’t a computer. each neuron is a computer. your cortex contains 17 billion computers.*

*it means the brain can do many computations beyond treating each neuron as a machine for summing up inputs and spitting out a spike. yet that’s the basis for all the units that make up an artificial neural network. it suggests that deep learning and its ai brethren have but glimpsed the computational power of an actual brain.*

*your cortex contains 17 billion neurons. to understand what they do, we often make analogies with computers. some use these analogies as cornerstones of their arguments. some consider them to be deeply misguided. our analogies often look to artificial neural networks: for neural networks compute, and they are made of up neuron-like things; and so, therefore, should brains compute. but if we think the brain is a computer, because it is like a neural network, then now we must admit that individual neurons are computers too. all 17 billion of them in your cortex; perhaps all 86 billion in your brain.*

*and so it means your cortex is not a neural network. your cortex is a neural network of neural networks.*

while this is an interesting [article](https://medium.com/the-spike/your-cortex-contains-17-billion-computers-9034e42d34f2) for deepening the complexity model of the brain, i feel that mere physical structure and behavior of subcomponents of neurons is only a tiny piece of the puzzle. 

to understand the workings of the brain you will also need to add in the complex interactions of hormones and other chemical agents in the brain and throughout the nervous system and the feedback loops they establish with the other systems of the body and through them, with the external world.

neural networks of neural networks doesn’t begin to describe it. we haven’t even scratched the tip of the tip of the iceberg in understanding this stuff.

* reproduce results on various tasks;
* support model exporting for deployment.

1,[D] A blog post on differential privacy,1,104,30,1552836999,"[d] a blog post on differential privacy hello r/ml,

i wrote a two-part blog post aiming to give a mathematical introduction to differential privacy. i start with basic definitions and finish with reproducing theoretical results (modulo a gap) from recent development in differentially private stochastic gradient descent and explaining the implementation of differential privacy in tensorflow, among other things.

links: [part 1]([https://ypei.me/posts/2019-03-13-a-tail-of-two-densities.html](https://ypei.me/posts/2019-03-13-a-tail-of-two-densities.html), [part 2]([https://ypei.me/posts/2019-03-14-great-but-manageable-expectations.html](https://ypei.me/posts/2019-03-14-great-but-manageable-expectations.html)

i hope you find it useful, and any feedback (bug reports, feature requests, questions, comments...) is welcome.

abstract: this is a two-part post where i give an introduction to differential privacy, which is a study of tail bounds of the divergence between probability measures, with the end goal of applying it to stochastic gradient descent.

in part 1 i start with the definition of ϵ-differential privacy (corresponding to max divergence), followed by (ϵ,δ)-differential privacy (a.k.a. approximate differential privacy, corresponding to the δ-approximate max divergence). i show a characterisation of the (ϵ,δ)-differential privacy as conditioned ϵ-differential privacy. also, as examples, i illustrate the ϵ-dp with laplace mechanism and, using some common tail bounds, the approximate dp with the gaussian mechanism.

then i continue to show the effect of combinatorial and sequential compositions of randomised queries (called mechanisms) on privacy by stating and proving the composition theorems for differential privacy, as well as the effect of mixing mechanisms, by presenting the subsampling theorem (a.k.a. amplification theorem).

in part 2, i discuss the rényi differential privacy, corresponding to the rényi divergence, a study of the moment generating functions of the divergence between probability measures to derive the tail bounds.

like in part 1, i prove a composition theorem and a subsampling theorem.

i also attempt to reproduce a seemingly better moment bound for the gaussian mechanism with subsampling, with one intermediate step which i am not able to prove.

after that i explain the tensorflow implementation of differential privacy in its privacy module, which focuses on the differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm (dp-sgd).

finally i use the results from both part 1 and part 2 to obtain some privacy guarantees for composed subsampling queries in general, and for dp-sgd in particular. i also compare these privacy guarantees.",39,2667,7,341

1,[D] Irresponsible anthropomorphism is killing AI journalism,1,528,69,1552511304,"[d] irresponsible anthropomorphism is killing ai journalism basically the title.  the current state of media coverage of ai is fixated on constructing a compelling narrative to readers, and often personifies models well beyond their capabilities.  this is to the extent that articles almost always end up reading like every classifier is some form of limited agi.

take [""meet norman the psychopathic ai""](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44040008), an article by the bbc, whom i generally consider quite capable journalists.  while the research methodology and some of the implications are discussed in the article, the majority of laypeople who encounter the article will likely erroneously conclude that norman possesses beliefs, a worldview, and some dark outlook on humanity.  some readers will think ""norman"" is violent or dangerous, with a mind of his own.  a headline and an image go a long way in communication, especially online.

and this article is by far not the worst offender. many news outlets perform much worse, publishing misleading, fearmongering, or sensationalist stories about ""some new ai"", borrowing from pop sci-fi tropes, with the star ai inevitably represented by lacklustre cg avatars bought off stock photo websites.

i remember having several discussions in the wake of the facebook experiment where researchers had ais communicate, and saw they developed a communication standard unreadable by humans.  based on the articles that circulated afterwards, a significant number of people concluded ""they had to turn it off because they were on the verge of skynet"".

in the interests of doing more than just ranting: how do we deal with this as a community?  should we be reaching out to journalists about these issues?  is it our responsibility in interviews to communicate the limitations of the models we develop?

personifying the projects we work on, and giving them human qualities, is certainly entertaining and helps market our research.  that said, it seems like a sizeable portion of the public has been misinformed about the state of machine learning research as a result.

talent hemorrhaging and recruitment.

although i don't think most modern dl research is directly inspired by neuroscience, there are some interesting connections i hadn't realized before. for example:

* resnet: the idea of a gradient super-highway is not so unlike the importance of signal propagation in long term potentiation (ltp), which is thought to underlie learning and memory in the brain. some researchers also believe that retrograde signaling happens in ltp, meaning that the ltp signal is back-propagated to the instigating pre-synaptic neuron. obviously, the connection with back-propagation in dl is clear, but backprop is not so much a new/modern technique.
* transfer learning: the ability of neuroplasticity in brain-injured or dear/blind peoples allows specialized neural regions to adapt and perform tasks outside their specialized region. for example, some blind people use their visual cortex more during language processing than the control. 
* capsule networks: actually indeed inspired by biology, these networks take a routing approach to visual classification. this relates to how the visual cortex has separate pathways for the *what* and *where* of an object and to how human vision is position and scale invariant, unlike traditional convolutional neural networks. evidently, hinton's paper directly cites a neuroscience paper on dynamic routing.
* self-play: recent advances like alphazero and openai five have shown the power of self-play in the rl domain. similarly, we know that practicing different skills, like music, can have long-term affects on brain structure and connections. however, these algorithms are able to make changes much faster to themselves than adults humans, so perhaps they are closer to the intensive neurogenesis and pruning period of early childhood.

these are just some examples i thought, and, although they aren't necessarily all inspired by neuroscience, i think that the connections should be taken more seriously. i think dismissing the connections between these two fields may be naive, and it seems neuroscience has a part to play in the future of deep learning.

the post highlights deep learning performance of rtx 2080 ti in tensorflow. the 2080 ti appears to be the best from a price / performance perspective. some highlights:

&#x200b;

**v100 vs. rtx 2080 ti**

* rtx 2080 ti is 87% as fast as the tesla v100 for fp32 training. 
* rtx 2080 ti is 55% as fast as tesla v100 for fp16 training.
* rtx 2080 ti is $1,199 vs. tesla v100 is $8,000+.

&#x200b;

**fp16 vs. fp32 of rtx 2080 ti**

* training in fp16 vs. fp32 has big performance benefit: +45% training speed. 

&#x200b;

**multi-gpu scaling:**

* scaling from 1 to 8 gpus isn't perfectly linear for any gpu.
* v100 scales best: going from 1 to 8 gpus gives a 7.3x speed boost
* rtx 2080 ti scales worst: going from 1 to 5 gpus gives 5x speed boost

i read this article from the link above. i tend to disagree with the notion that the data science job will be eliminated by auto machine learning software packages like data robot. i hate the idea of someone just throwing their data in and getting results. from my experience as a data scientist, it takes time and energy to analyze the data, implement feature engineering, and evaluating model performance based on the data. 

as for “we are automating ourselves out of our job”. well yeah that’s the idea. and that’s not a bad thing. however, i think we automate one process to move on to automate something else, especially with all types of new data  coming into the digital world.

i do find it interesting how the author splits the new data science work into 5 areas that will take place at n 5-10 years. do you agree with this assessment? will the data scientist “boom” disappear? will it be replaced by a more specific job? what do you think? if these changes are true, how does it impact our work?",118,1112,18,181

i've played around with sex-changing voice changers in the past, and the common limitation among all of them is that there is nothing being done besides raising or dropping the pitch, and this doesn't lead to a believable effect since gendered speaking patterns exist in most societies. without accounting for differences in cadences, you merely wind up with voices that sound like chipmunks or homosexual demons. this requires neural networks, but i haven't found many good ones.

even 2 years ago, i'd have said this was many decades out, but now i'm not so sure. i feel i could say ""we'll see something like this by 2029"" and then someone demonstrates the exact same thing within 6 months. i say this because it's exactly what happened with openai's text synthesis a couple weeks ago. i said to someone ""someone might create a short, coherent story via ai by 2025 or so."" valentine's day 2019 rolled around, and...

**abstract:**

adaptive optimization methods such as adagrad, rmsprop and adam have been proposed to achieve a rapid training process with an element-wise scaling term on learning rates. though prevailing, they are observed to generalize poorly compared with sgd or even fail to converge due to unstable and extreme learning rates. recent work has put forward some algorithms such as amsgrad to tackle this issue but they failed to achieve considerable improvement over existing methods. in our paper, we demonstrate that extreme learning rates can lead to poor performance. we provide new variants of adam and amsgrad, called adabound and amsbound respectively, which employ dynamic bounds on learning rates to achieve a gradual and smooth transition from adaptive methods to sgd and give a theoretical proof of convergence. we further conduct experiments on various popular tasks and models, which is often insufficient in previous work. experimental results show that new variants can eliminate the generalization gap between adaptive methods and sgd and maintain higher learning speed early in training at the same time. moreover, they can bring significant improvement over their prototypes, especially on complex deep networks. the implementation of the algorithm can be found at [https://github.com/luolc/adabound](https://github.com/luolc/adabound).

i wanted to hear the community's opinion on my current situation and see what people think in general about a career decision that i'm seriously considering. (sorry if this is not the right place for this.)

i'm currenly working as a software engineer at a widely-recognized financial institution. this is my first job and i've been within the firm for about two years now. the money is alright, it's also not a stressful job. the thing is that this is not the kind of job that i want to do for the rest of my life. my master's thesis (engineering) was focused around ml and ever since graduating, i've been exploring it, mostly deep learning, on my own in my spare time mostly via online courses and books as i really enjoyed it. then i discovered rl and immediately fell in love. after doing even more online courses and starting some self-assigned projects, i realized i wanted to transition to ml, preferably rl.

currently my portfolio and ml project experience are way too weak for getting a good job in the area. i would preferably become involved in research as an engineer and later on, if things go well, perhaps start a phd in cs. recently i realized that there is no way i can improve at a decent pace as my 9-5 job is taking away a big part of my time and even if i manage to keep learning before/after work (as i've been doing for the past 15 months or so), it's going to take me a lot of time to achieve a decent level, not to mention taking away almost my whole free time and social life.

i finally came to the conclusion that the only way for me to step up in ml/rl is to quit my job and get engaged with researchers in order to have my name put on a research paper, which is often a ""nice-to-have"" requirement when i'm looking at different ml/rl engineer job offers. this would also help me grow my portfolio which is at least equally as important. i recently met a group of researchers (phds and phd students) at the uni in my town who might be interested in cooperating however this wouldn't be a regular job, more likely just a collaboration which would eventually end up publishing a paper together.

i would like to know if quitting my job without having a new one lined up is a terrible idea career-wise. i heard that some hr departments are reluctant to hire people who are currently unemployed, so this might be a risky move. on the other hand i know that if i don't do something about my current situation, i'll end up remaining in my current job (or similar) for the rest of my life. money is not a concern for me at the moment - i can afford several months of unemployment. i basically want to know what does the community think about this and if i'm missing anything.

any input is really appreciated. thanks in advance :)",104,2767,22,507

recent methods generalize convolutional layers from euclidean domains to  graph-structured data by approximating the eigenbasis of the graph  laplacian. the computationally-efficient and broadly-used graph convnet  of kipf & welling, over-simplifies the approximation, effectively  rendering graph convolution as a neighborhood-averaging operator. this  simplification restricts the model from learning delta operators, the  very premise of the graph laplacian.  in this work, we propose a new  graph convolutional layer which mixes multiple powers of the adjacency  matrix, allowing it to learn delta operators. our layer exhibits the  same memory footprint and computational complexity as a gcn. we  illustrate the strength of our proposed layer on both synthetic graph  datasets, and on several real-world citation graphs, setting the record  state-of-the-art on pubmed.",90,1169,12,133

hey all

wanted to get the community's input on my current situation and see what people think, especially regarding the importance of who you work with and the group that you are in during your phd. some background:

i'm currently finishing my master's in computer science at a pretty decent school (top 15). my main research interests are in nlp and machine learning. i've spent the past year doing biomedical nlp and machine learning research. i published two papers during my master's (one first author) but not at top conferences. prior to my masters i worked in industry as a software engineer for 2.5 years, and during my undergrad i did research for two years on some applied machine learning and published 6 papers (one as first author, again not at top venues). when i applied for grad school straight out of undergrad, i was rejected by every program (stanford, uw, ucsd, uc berkeley, uc irvine, and mit). i tried again next year, and was again rejected by every phd program but was accepted by the one master's program to which i applied. looking back i understand why i was rejected (i was definitely not high enough caliber to get in at the time). now i've applied again to phd programs, and it is looking like i will again be rejected by all of them (nyu cds, columbia, stanford, uw, mit, cmu, ut austin, and ucsd). i picked those schools specifically for the mentorship i would receive and the types of problems being worked on there. however, i will most likely be able to transfer into the phd program at my current school.

i'm still certain that i want to pursue a phd; i love exploring nlp and machine learning, and enjoy asking interesting research questions and discovering new knowledge in the process of answering those questions. if i stay in my current lab, i will most likely be able to continue doing that. additionally, i ultimately want to become a professor and do research/teach. i have funding on my current project, and will potentially be able to get a decent fellowship through our industry partners. i will also be doing a research internship in industry this summer which will hopefully open some more doors.

my biggest concern is that my current lab is not well connected to the larger field of nlp. my advisor publishes mostly in bioinformatics journals and conferences, while i'm more interested in conferences such as neurips, acl, naacl, emnlp, aaai and the like. they are currently trying to break into those communities but as of now they are not well connected and have limited history with publishing at those venues. additionally, i'm somewhat siloed from the main nlp group on campus. i had briefly worked with one of the nlp profs on a project for a quarter but they did not continue our work due to ""resource constraints"" (in reality there was a difference in communication styles so we just didn't mesh very well).

so i guess the main things i need input on are: do i stay in my current lab for my phd or do i try to improve my publication record this/next year, get better connected with the community, and apply again in the future? if i wait and apply again, what should be my course of action in the mean time (i'd like to continue doing research somehow or at least be doing something to advance my research goals)? how important is who you work with during your phd? will staying in a not well connected lab lead to limited prospects after my phd (in terms of post-doc, industry labs, etc.)? is it possible to have a satisfying career in this field without being in a top lab? i guess that last question depends on how you gauge satisfaction, which to me mostly lies in working on problems i consider interesting and exciting, but also that other people consider interesting as measured by publication in good (top) venues.

as a side note, my gpa is definitely not the issue (4.0 in undergrad, 3.92 in master's), my master's program is generally considered ""elite"", and my gre is not too terrible (159/165/4 v/q/w).

thanks for taking the time to read this if you got this far :) any input is appreciated!",95,4492,17,783

i have seen so many articles relating to deploying a single model, but is usually not a time series model. this situation would be akin to the [rossman sales data on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). they want to forecast sales for 1000 of their stores each with its own sales data. didn't see any discussions on there regarding actual deployment of those approaches in practice.

we want to either have an endpoint stood up that will grab the trained model for that week and spit back the forecast, but if that is all it does then we might as well do a bulk update and persist the results. we could do it just-in-time and only update the model as it is used and have a model expire after a while.

just not sure on best practices for this type of problem. how do companies forecast for all of their items like at wal-mart and amazon? thank you.",78,1451,11,256

i honestly think that the research direction the original [differentiable plasticity paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02464) opened is more revolutionary than it seems at first glance.

not only does it have great tie ins to biologically plausible learning, it is the first time i saw a rnn being used to update another network's weights. because now a successful example of that exists, a vast range of research into biologically plausible learning rules and not just hebbian learning is suddenly live and could potentially be used to great effect as a part of deep learning.

right now, all metalearning approaches have significant flaws:

1) maml - in addition to being expensive, it has the large disadvantage of introducing the artificial metatraining/training separation.

2) snail - it is a particularly large architecture.

3) plasticity - it requires copying the plastic weights at every timestep in order to backprop through it. this is a huge memory expenditure.

in case of plasticity it is actually possible to work around its disadvantages by reversing the weight updates. i've done a little numerical stability testing of how various update rules behave in reverse mode and have discovered that while the ema and oja's rules from the original paper are stable for 1k-10k steps after which the weights explode due to exponential accumulation of error, weight norm can be reversed for 100s of thousands of timesteps with only tiny error even when float32 types are used.

when [reversible computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqz_bqbxsxk) finally arrives it will have significant implications for learning.

there was [a reversible learning paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03492) from 2015 which used it to optimize hyperparameters that i now see in an entirely different light. it is really too bad this was not tried for networks in networks.

that having said simple local unsupervised learning rules like for hebbian learning have their advantages in that they can be easily reversed and would not require higher order differentiation for that to be done.

the backpropamine paper is actually quite surprising to me in its content - in my own testing on binary pattern i've tried modulating the weight updates directly as was done in the paper, but i've found it to be highly unstable and eventually removed it. that might have been because i was modulating the plasticity coefficients in tandem with that so it might be worth revisiting. at least on the binary pattern, i've found modulating the plasticity coefficients to work very well - the plastic rnn from the original paper takes over 1k iterations to get to 99% sign accuracy on the binary pattern test. the architecture that modulates the plasticity coefficients managed to get to that point in about 60.

but that is just one sample on a toy task - there is a lot of work to be done before this line of research comes to fruition and it should be interesting follow as plasticity enables capabilities that would otherwise be impossible in regular rnns. i'd like to see this tried on dota and starcraft. a recent [r2d2 paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1lytjaqyx) came out showing great gains in using a lstm for learning value-action functions and better memories in a rnn will only extend that advantage.",104,3353,10,513

* representation learning for nodes and edges, to be used for visualization and various downstream machine learning tasks;
* classification and attribute inference of nodes or edges;
* link prediction.

 we provide [examples](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/master/demos/) of using stellargraph to solve such tasks using several real-world datasets. 

we welcome your feedback and contributions.

the idea described in perturbative neural networks is to replace 3x3 convolution with 1x1 convolution, with some noise applied to the input. it was claimed to perform just as well. to me, this did not make much sense, so i decided to test it. the authors conveniently provided their code, but on closer inspection, turns out they calculated test accuracy incorrectly, which invalidates all their results.

*your $700 nvidia 1080 ti performs at 90% speed compared to the cloud nvidia v100 gpu (which uses next gen volta tech). this is because cloud gpus suffer from slow io between the instance and the gpu, so even though the v100 may be 1.5–2x faster in theory, io slows it down in practice. since you’re using a m.2 ssd, io is blazing fast on your own computer.*

*the machine i built costs $3k and has the parts shown below. there’s one 1080 ti gpu to start (you can just as easily use the new 2080 ti for machine learning at $500 more — just be careful to get one with a blower fan design), a 12 core cpu, 64gb ram, and 1tb m.2 ssd. you can add three more gpus easily for a total of four.*

the author claims that the breakeven cost is ~ 2 months for single gpu vs aws, and 2 weeks for the 4 gpu version, though one has to be careful with choosing components that will support well the 4 gpu version (he will discuss the nuances in a later post).

for those not familiar with rts and build orders, a build order is a sequence of build commands that gets you to a game state. they are a means to and end to get to where you want in the game. the goal of a build order is to get you to a game state as fast as possible. at the highest levels of starcraft, people abuse their opponent's build order and try to attack when they are weakest (called a timed attack). 

the search space for starcraft is incredibly large, each game state has a range of [4, 35], which produces a very large search space very quickly. it is very exciting to see such an optimal search of such a large search space. ",102,1225,14,205

[sample teaser.](https://i.redd.it/k2u6z0ueq0n11.png)

  

hi reddit machinelearning! we are the team of style2paints. we are very excited to release our 2018 september project: mangacraft. via our application, everyone can colorize their favorite manga!

manga is significantly different from line drawings, which has been studied by style2paints or paintschainer. we need to use different algorithms to deal with these. our new mangacraft is designed to only colorize standard full-page manga. both asia manga and western manga are ok. so please do not upload line drawings, and please upload manga pages.

strength:

\* the quality is super high. we believe that, if our software is properly used, the results can directly serve in industrial or commercial manga printing (real paper manga or online e-manga) and publication. previous models, e.g. paintschainer and style2paints, are designed to colorize line drawings, and are not good at coloring manga. the results from mangacraft are sharp and clean.

weakness:

\* the user time-consuming is relatively long. we have about 30 testing users. all of them are non-artists. after several colorization attempts, most of them can coloring manga at the speed of 15 minutes per manga page. this is longer than style2paints (3 minutes per line drawing) or paintschainer (1 minute per line drawing). we assume that this is because manga page is much more complex than simple line drawing.

###what is it?

the dataset used is semantic scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a word2vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. the database contains 1,666,577 papers, mostly in the computer science field. you can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. you can also make tsne maps of those recommendations. 

https://i.imgur.com/b4qdocc.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/ocgp0mv.jpg


###where is it?

github

https://github.com/santosh-gupta/research2vec/blob/master/research2vecpublicplayground.ipynb

or direct look to google colab

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-0ggls2r-5nwdwb-tnwqr2osaixqnesl

###what can you do with it ?

you can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. i've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 1,666,577 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the tsne maps)

now, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:

you can see a tsne map of how those similar papers are related to each other. the tsne takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). you can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.

you can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). 

finally, my favorite part, you can get tsne maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. 

**a great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. you can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** 

### how important is this ?

when i was in r&d, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. but we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.

there's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.

i've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.

even the google brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. a few months ago they released a paper of swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.

> ""as has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. the fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough >enough literature search. my sincere apologies. we will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/

so if this is something that happens to the google brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.

here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

word2bits - quantized word vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

binary latent representations for efficient ranking: empirical assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.

###how do i use it ?

i tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff i didn't take into account. let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. if you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and i'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )

here's a step by step guide to help people get started

**step 1:** 

run the section 1 of code in the colab notebook. this will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, ids, and links. 

https://snag.gy/rmocxo.jpg

**step 2:**

find the papers want to find similar papers for at semantic scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org

get either the title or semantic scholar's paperid, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. for example, in this link

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/distributed-representations-of-sentences-and-le-mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3

the semantic scholar paper id is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'

use the title(s) and/or semantic scholar's paperid(s) with section 2 and section 3 to get the embedid from the model. embedids are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperid). 

https://snag.gy/3yjx2o.jpg

the embedid is what each dictionary first returns. 

**step 3:**

insert the embedid(s) as the values of paper1embedid, paper2embedid, paper3embedid, paper4embedid, etc. 

https://snag.gy/azep91.jpg

if you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change this line 

`extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 + paper3 + paper4`

and create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction

    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1embedid , axis=0)   
    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2embedid , axis=0) 
    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3embedid , axis=0)   
    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4embedid , axis=0) 

finally, run section 4 to get a tsne map of the recomendations. with 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. 

**ask any question you have no matter how minor, i want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** 

### other details

so it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; i think the corpus was last updated in may 2018. due to the limitation on my computational resources (google colab) i had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. a connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. i filtered to only include papers with 20 or more connections because colab would crash if i tried to include more. 

as of right now, the recommender has 1,666,577 papers. i hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. 

### feedback greatly appreciated !

i am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. i am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. i am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit (kinda like facebook senteval https://github.com/facebookresearch/senteval ) that i can use to tune the hyperparameters. 

of course, i would very much appreciate whatever feedback, questions, comments, thoughts you have on this project. ",300,7644,51,1166

**what?**

[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) is an open and free ml course led by opendatascience, or [ods.ai](https://ods.ai), a big (>15k members) community known firstly for its top kagglers. the course is 10-week long and has lots of practice including assignments (each week), kaggle inclass competitions, individual projects and tutorials. however, focus is made on a perfect balance between theory and practice, so [prerequisites](https://github.com/yorko/mlcourse.ai/wiki/prerequisites:-python,-math-and-devops) include both basic math concepts and python skills.

this is actually a mooc, \~4k guys already passed it in russian, now is the second time the course launches in english.

**what's so special about the course?**

* there will be an interactive student rating making it fun to participate and motivating to endure till the end
* it's not for beginners, the pace is pretty intensive
* the course is supported by a big and alive community, you''ll find authors of articles/assignments/competitions right in the same slack channel. we chat informally, with jokes and gags
* we prefer text to video, all main material is already there in a form of medium articles and jupyter notebooks, [https://mlcourse.ai/resources](https://mlcourse.ai/resources)

https://i.redd.it/b6t22gi491k11.png

there are a number of forms of forgetting in the human brain, and this is a normal, adaptive, and necessary process for learning. one of the more interesting is the active form that helps us concentrate on some special task by moving all information that is unnecessary at that moment to unconscious memory. hermann ebbinghaus, a german psychologist, became the first person to study memory experimentally. in his early experiments, he encountered the problem of proving that something has been completely forgotten because, allegedly, forgotten information can still affect behaviour and is quite often remembered later. as a result, a definition was proposed that forgetting is the inability to extract from memory at a particular given moment something that was readily extracted from memory earlier.

later experiments on memory were conducted on the mollusc lymnaea stagnalis due to the fact that their nerve cells are rather large, with many of those nerves identified and their functions described. there is one nerve cell without which l. stagnalis cannot learn a new skill. if this cell is destroyed, the molluscs not only lose the ability to learn, they also do not forget previously learned behaviours. the model in this study proposes to translate this function into artificial neural networks and define the architecture with active forgetting mechanisms, which gives the name of the model, active forgetting machine (afm). the afm contains special neural networks that allow temporary forgetting of unnecessary information by disabling unwanted neurons, and then other combinations of neurons are activated to learn and solve some task.

thanks so much for all the support redditors for hyperlearn! [https://github.com/danielhanchen/hyperlearn](https://github.com/danielhanchen/hyperlearn) \[made it to the trending github list for jup notebooks!! yayy!\]

anyways, i didn't update the code a lot, but that's because i was busily testing and finding out which algos were the most stable and best.

key findings for n = 5,000 p = 6,000 \[more features than n near square matrix\]

1. for pseudoinverse, (used in linear reg, ridge reg, lots of other algos), jit, scipy mkl, pinvh, pinv2 and hyperlearn's pinv are very similar. pytorch's is clearly problematic, having close to over x4 slower than scipy mkl.
2. for eigh (used in pca, lda, qda, other algos), sklearn's pca utilises svd. clearly, not a good idea, since it is much better to compute the eigenvec / eigenval on xtx. jit eigh is the clear winner at 14.5 seconds on xtx, whilst numpy is 2x slower. torch likewise is slower once again...
3. so, for pca, a speedup of 3 times is seem if using jit compiled eigh when compared to sklearn's pca
4. to solve x\*theta = y, torch gels is super unstable. like really. if you use torch gels, don't forget to call theta\_hat\[np.isnan(theta\_hat) | np.isinf(theta\_hat)\] = 0, or else results are problematic. all other algos have very similar mses, and hyperlearn's regularized cholesky solve takes a mere 0.635 seconds when compared to say using sklearn's next fastest ridge solve (via cholesky) by over 100% (after considering matrix multiplication time) --> hyperlearn 2.89s vs 4.53s sklearn.

so to conclude:

1. hyperlearn's pseudoinverse has no speed improvement
2. hyperlearn's pca will have over 2 times speed boost. (200% improvement)
3. hyperlearn's linear solvers will be over 1 times faster. (100% improvement)

1,[R] Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes,1,79,21,1535669759,"[r] deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes aftershocks are a response to changes in stress generated by large earthquakes and represent the most common observations of the triggering of earthquakes. the maximum magnitude of aftershocks and their temporal decay are well described by empirical laws (such as bath’s law1 and omori’s law2), but explaining and forecasting the spatial distribution of aftershocks is more difficult. coulomb failure stress change3 is perhaps the most widely used criterion to explain the spatial distributions of aftershocks but its applicability has been disputed. here we use a deep-learning approach to identify a static-stress-based criterion that forecasts aftershock locations without prior assumptions about fault orientation. we show that a neural network trained on more than 131,000 mainshock–aftershock pairs can predict the locations of aftershocks in an independent test dataset of more than 30,000 mainshock–aftershock pairs more accurately (area under curve of 0.849) than can classic coulomb failure stress change (area under curve of 0.583). we find that the learned aftershock pattern is physically interpretable: the maximum change in shear stress, the von mises yield criterion (a scaled version of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress-change tensor) and the sum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change tensor each explain more than 98 per cent of the variance in the neural-network prediction. this machine-learning-driven insight provides improved forecasts of aftershock locations and identifies physical quantities that may control earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle.",68,1655,9,240

assuming you're not working at google, have constrained resources and deadlines, how do you stay productive when models you're training take days-weeks to converge?

main things that worked for me:

1. training on subset / smaller dataset first before scaling things up
2. starting new experiments from previous model checkpoints
3. experiment queuing system that keeps gpus hot 24/7
4. working on other things while the models are running (data collection / cleaning)


are there any tools or workflow changes that have improved your productivity? airflow? hyperparameter optimization tools? experiment tracking? architecture search? testing? docker?

one of the problems though was that its speed wasn't always optimal and often times it was taking some pretty tight turns or turns with poor visibility at full speed.

we know that tesla is building maps for their autopilot suite so the car can have an internal knowledge of the environment and these maps have (among other things) hardcoded speed limits for turns or certain sections of the road but i don't really know how tesla or the whole industry in general determines the optimal speed the system should be aiming for (if they even do that and tesla isn't just doing it till their software gets better at reading the road/environment).

while watching the video i was thinking that if cars were logging the location (gps data), speed and traffic data for every road they are being driven on (tesla, mobileye and possibly others can already do this) then given enough data one could easily determine the optimal speed for every single stretch of road and particularly the speed before, during and after a curve, hill or other difficult/dangerous spot.

the other is called extremistan, which describes a more pareto like or fat-tailed distribution. an example is wealth distribution, 1% of people own 50% of the wealth or something close to that and so predictability from limited data sets is much harder or even impossible. this is because you can add a single sample to your data set and the consequences are so large that it breaks the model, or has an effect so large that it cancels out any of the benefits from prior accurate predictions. in fact this is how he claims to have made money in the stock market, because everyone else was using bad, gaussian distribution models to predict the market, which actually would work for a short period of time but when things went wrong, they went really wrong which would cause you to have net losses in the market.

i found this video of taleb being asked about ai. his claim is that a.i. doesn't work (as well) for things that fall into extremistan.

is he right? will some things just be inherently unpredictable even with a.i.?

we would like to hear your opinion about the possibility of changing the name of the nips conference. arguments in favor of keeping the existing name include a desire to respect the intellectual tradition that brought the meeting to where it is today and the strong brand that comes with this tradition. arguments in favor of changing the name include a desire to better reflect the modern scope of the conference and to avoid distasteful connotations of the name.

do you think we should change the name of the nips conference?

if we were to change the name of the nips conference, to what degree do you like the following suggestions? among the many alternative names suggested by respondents to our first poll, the following are under consideration:

iclips (pronounced eclipse): international conference on learning and information processing systems

icols, icls, and cls: variants of the previous name

nils: neural information and learning systems

nals: natural and artificial learning systems

snips: synthetic and neural information processing systems

moreover, to some of these alternatives, one can consider adding the subtitle ""natural and synthetic"" or the subtitle ""artificial and natural"".

1,"[D] How can a machine learn a real dictionary, since they are full of circular dependencies?",1,84,46,1533981575,"[d] how can a machine learn a real dictionary, since they are full of circular dependencies? i'm a programmer without a ml background, so i apologize if i don't use the right terminology here and for my lack of ml culture. i'm just very curious about that topic from a theoretical point of view.

a real dictionary defines words using other words. for instance, the words 'a', 'b', and 'c' could be defined like so:

* a: 'b c'
* b: 'a c'
* c: 'a b'

in regular programming, that's straight up circular dependencies, and any program would choke on that. so i'm wondering how can ais do it (can they even do that yet?), and what kind of approaches work.

i think the way it works for children is that they are taught some essential words like ""dog"" and ""black"" with sensorial association (visual, behaviorial, tactile, auditive...), and then they are taught ""the dog is black"", so that's when they figure out what ""the"" and ""is"" mean. from there they can expand their vocabulary exponentially.

for machines i have a few naive ideas of how it would work, and would be interested in hearing what you think about them, and if there are better ones:

* if the ai is smart enough, it could ""figure it out"" by keeping not-yet-understood definitions in memory and put things together with logic at the end. that would be incredible if that's possible.
* maybe hard-coding some definitions with a language that is understood by machines instead of human language could bootstrap the learning process. just like children learn visually, we could hard-code ""the"", ""dog"", ""is"", ""black"" without using english definitions. once you reach a critical mass of definitions, it should unlock every english definition.
* maybe it is possible to create english-like dictionaries specifically for machines that have less circular dependencies? it's impossible to have zero circular dependencies, but an optimized dictionary could avoid hard-coding too many definitions.

what do you think?

thanks for reading.

edit: thanks everyone for your great answers. it seems like you all agree that dictionaries are not how humans nor machines should learn the meaning of words. just like how we use them, they can surely still be useful to an ai that already knows a language and needs help on one specific word, but they don't seem to be complete enough to establish a ground floor of truth.",92,2271,16,374

1,[Discussion] What is your opinion of Probabilistic Programming?,1,182,62,1533464244,"[discussion] what is your opinion of probabilistic programming? probabilistic programming has been slowly gaining momentum over the past few years. particularly, the likes of josh tenenbaum and his students have been making ever stronger arguments for ""intuitive physics"", ""inverse graphics"" and more generally for structured generative models. i really like how it combines the robust learning of statistical methods, while also being good at symbolic reasoning like gofai techniques. it has also gained traction in industry, with uber releasing their own probabilistic programming library on top of pytorch. many top researchers have also begun writing papers on it and discussing it in main conferences. 

while the philosophy behind it sounds inspiring, i haven't seen a killer demo that has convinced me of its potential: sort of like what alex khrizhevsky's imagenet result did for deep learning. bayesian program learning (bpl) by brenden lake came close, but it's results were matched and surpassed by deep learning methods in just a couple of years. and i am not aware of any other big result with bpl.

to be honest, i don't see why something like probabilistic programming is necessary for ai/agi. seems to me that the people working on it are very rigorous seeking most general versions of things, hence working on turing complete languages, general inference mechanisms etc.,but at the end of the day its still bayesian --- so requires a prior, there is no free lunch and so depends a lot on domain-expertise to setup the model and hand tune the inference mechanism. rich sutton recently said (to paraphrase) ""domain agnostic methods will always eventually surpass domain specific methods"". he hence encouraged working on domain agnostic methods, i guess being inspired by his own work in rl. this makes the future of probabilistic programming look not so promising to me. this is of course my biased opinion.

what are your thoughts and insights about this? is it the next big thing or will it go in the same direction as gofai? or will it find a niche in some areas?",63,2017,8,330

1,[D] Declarative syntax for RNNs,1,42,24,1532974955,"[d] declarative syntax for rnns i work at microsoft research montreal and i recently made a prototype.  i'm wondering if there's community interest in the idea that would justify turning it into a full-fledged project.  the idea is to let people write the recurrence relations that define their model directly, instead of translating them into imperative-style loops first.  as an extremely simple example, one can define the fibonacci sequence like

    f[0] = 0;
    f[1] = 1;
    f[i] = f[i-2] + f[i-1];

and then `runtime.compute(""f[8]"") == 21` etc.  here's an lstm implemented manually:

    i[t] = sigmoid(ui@h[t-1] + wi@x[t] + bi);
    o[t] = sigmoid(uo@h[t-1] + wo@x[t] + bo);
    f[t] = sigmoid(uf@h[t-1] + wf@x[t] + bf);
    c[t] = f[t]*c[t-1] + i[t]*tanh(uc@h[t-1] + wc@x[t] + bc);
    h[t] = o[t]*tanh(c[t]);

which you can evaluate with something like

    with runtime.given({""h[-1]"": init_hidden, ""c[-1]"": init_cell, ""x"": input}):
        h_last = symbol(""h"", [input.size(0) - 1])
        value = runtime.compute(h_last)

the idea is to make it easier to experiment with different recurrent architectures by making the code more closely match the actual formulas involved.  more exotic things like grid lstms would just be minor variations of the code above.  there are some other potential niceties (imo):

    b[i,j,k] = a[j,i,k]; # easier to grok than permute(1, 0, 2)?

    c[i,k] = a[i,j]*b[j,k]; # einsum

thoughts?  is this something you would be interested in?  the prototype supports pytorch, but tensorflow support should be possible too.",31,1531,5,276

i have been working in machine learning development for a long time now, but i felt it was time i went into the science, and actually did some research work, to grow my knowledge. as part of my research, one goal i have would is to publish something useful, i actually want to contribute something of worth.  


the trickiest part for me is deciding on what to do. i know i am really interested in memory and few shot learning. but any idea i have, a google search shows it has already been done. i am really interested in few shot learning, but every idea i have, is either already investigated, or doesn't contribute much to our collective knowledge (is incremental at best).

at this point, it seems if i go down one path to investigate, it might turn out to be a giant waste of time. so as a real big newbie, who has never contributed to research, what would you're advice be to me? how does one decide on a research hypothesis?

thanks for helping me out.",69,986,14,179

1,[D] Debate about science at organizations like Google Brain/FAIR/DeepMind,1,202,121,1531595172,"[d] debate about science at organizations like google brain/fair/deepmind there's an interesting debate going on (unfortunately via twitter) about science in orgs like google brain/fair/deepmind:

https://twitter.com/simondedeo/status/1017616703864307712

here's the post by the cmu professor:

> ok: following, my thoughts on google brain and similar institutions. disclaimer: this is my opinion, as someone who doesn't need their funding, and has built a career without needing to flatter them. (an anti-disclaimer, if you will.)

> i grew up in the bayesian era—i watched @davidspergel and his band of merry scientists change our view of the world with a few simple, theoretically-motivated equations.
that's what i brought to the table when i went out to study living and thinking systems. around 2010, of course, the deep learning revolution became impossible to ignore.

> it was exciting stuff. we'd have people visit the institute and tell us about decision trees, random forests,—all sorts of wonderful things. i tried to get a handle on it but (honestly) there was so much we could do with simple tools that it was never a priority.
when i got to iu, i was hired as a prof in the informatics department, @iusoice (informatics==the future of cs—i.e., forget quicksort, let's work out what these machines are doing to human life). i was on a hiring committee, and we were keen to get a deep learning hire.

> i took all the candidates out to breakfast (i was a naughty hire, and skipped meetings and committees to spend my time with research students and undergrads, this was the one gap i had).
i tried to work out what deep learning was about. most of the candidates were too sleep deprived to dissemble. basic answer: every sexy project we do—flying quadcopters, getting another 0.1% on the mnist—is basically one graduate student.
you work out the topology of the neural net. then you find the weights. how? the answer: ""graduate student descent"", a little pun to giggle over floppy croissants at the student cafe—in short, there's no good answer, a human being sits there and twiddles things about.

> machine learning is an amazing accomplishment of engineering. but it's not science. not even close. it's just 1990, scaled up. it has given us *literally* no more insight than we had twenty years ago.
""deep learning implements the renormalization group!"" yeah, i heard that too. if you have a system where information is organized spatially, is it really a surprise that the neurons group information together spatially?
i'd get invited to meetings at google research, or wherever. they had security like crazy—worse than a hedge fund. a security guard would follow you to the bathroom.
each scientist at my ""grade""—i.e., the equivalent of a junior faculty member, someone who should be out on the edge of knowledge—was, instead, managing a team of ten people doing graduate student descent.
google can beat university of kansas for the sole reason that they can hire ten times more graduate students per researcher. the difference, of course, is that a graduate student at uk has the chance to do something intellectually significant. not true at gr.
they had no idea what they were doing. they had the manpower (word chosen advisedly) to apply deep learning to anything, simulating the schrodinger equation, drug design, anything. their main goal was to find the scientific field they could have the maximum impact on.
i've visited probably fifty universities. i love it. everywhere i go, i get new ideas. it's one of the best features of my job. there's one exception: commercial ""research"" labs.
if you want to build machines that monitor people and sell them more ads faster, go for it. if you want to find problem where you can take a working-class job, model the man or woman who does it, and build a net to put them out of a job without compensation, be my guest.
have we done science with something google research has built? absolutely. we have a great paper coming out where we use word2vec to help build a theory of puzzle solving.
but we could have built a system of equal utility ourselves. there's zero intellectual contribution there. i'm not joking, and i'll go head-to-head with anyone who says i am.
i got a nice cold-call from a top-flight masters' student in cs, as i do sometimes (please keep them coming, i can pay). i flew him out and we started working on a problem in the emergence of social cooperation. he wanted to do dl.
two weeks in we were a step beyond what google brain was doing. i don't mean technically—they had amazing youtube videos of sprites in a landscape. i *do* mean intellectually. their demos were like 2018 meets something out of the 1980s.
they said they did social science, but it was nothing of the sort. it was homo economicus spread out over 50 gpus. at best, a devastating proof-by-example of need for academia. buy a copy of bowles and ginits, cooperative species, and you'll learn more than they did, in a week.
can you do cool research at google brain? honest answer: no. you will be on the cutting edge of machine learning, yes—an engineering discipline whose basic goals are set by large corporations. but you will not be a scientist.
i get that you may need to make money. you can make a lot there, and all the jobs at renaissance technology are taken. go for it—you have all my respect. academia sucks.
but if you want, at some point in your flourishing career, with your mind and your soul, to join the two-thousand year old parade of intellectual progress, you are not going to do it at google. certainly not at facebook.
if you want to do that, i have a suggestion. it's not the only path, by any means, and i've had amazing fellow-travellers who haven't. but here it is.
go to graduate school. do a phd. with us, here at cmu/sds, if you like—but we're not the only place that does computational social or cognitive science. you won't get paid much, but you will mentors who legitimately care about the development of your mind.
it's difficult to overestimate the difference between a good phd program and industry. it is literally shameful, if you're a good phd advisor, to interfere with the intellectual development of a student. at google, it's a business plan.
none of this is a joke. this is ten years of experience. graduate school applications are coming up in the fall. think about it. make sure you're getting a good deal (you shouldn't go into debt for a phd, and you should get healthcare).
in short: corporate ""research"" is a business proposition. whatever true intellectual progress comes out of there happens in spite of management. given how good these companies are at monitoring their employees, that gap is now miniscule.
last anecdote, then i'm done. we visited google research, arranged by a contact. the people were unbelievably smart. we brainstormed all sorts of wonderful things to work on. the last day of the meeting, the academics were like, ok! let's go to the pub! let's hash this out!
their response: this was vacation for us. we're behind on our real work. we have to work this weekend. (not ""we feel guilty"", but ""we have to"".) for the academics in the room, this *was* work. suddenly, i realized that this was vacation for them.

lately, i have been working on [pocket-tensor](https://github.com/gvaliente/pocket-tensor), a [kerasify](https://github.com/moof2k/kerasify) fork designed for running sequential networks generated by keras 2.x on embedded devices.  

it is easy to build and run, since there's no external dependencies. it performs predictions on multiple cpu cores, while keeping ram usage at a minimum. at last, build times are not too slow, since the library is not header-only.

if you have time please tell me what you think. thanks!

but writing python scripts has its own benefits. you save writing  redundant code for different experiments. for changing some line in a  function you don't have to change that function in all the experiments'  codes. you can also run these scripts directly through the command line.

1,[D] Machine Learning MASSIVELY Undersold on Freelance Websites,1,30,37,1529848550,"[d] machine learning massively undersold on freelance websites i wanted to start a discussion regarding the rates i am seeing fellow machine learning peoples post on freelance website, and frankly i think people post some absurdly low numbers; albeit with some more reasonable numbers. i am a research scientist at a top ten computer science university by day, but i have been spending the last ""240 minutes"" of my day trying to develop my own brand or start some sort of side hustle. this is all with support of my wife and son (to give some context). personally, i think as a freelancer, i am worth at least 100$ an hour. i think that is on the low end of the spectrum, because while i have experience implementing many ml/dl models -- i'm new to freelancing.

in general, i have seen people commonly posting they charge 20-40 bucks an hour on upwork. this number would be fine if you were an employee at some organization where they take on much of the overhead (you don't have to find work, they take on the financial responsibility of that)... but as freelancers we are operating on our own brand usually in our off time.

let me explain why i think this is a bit crazy with a few bullet points.

* you are spending resources to find work (off hours, etc) unpaid
* you are spending resources not investing in your own brand (working on your own startup, personal projects, reading textbooks)
* you are spending resources not doing the things you love (hanging out with family, playing dark souls).
* ml takes a large time investment (heck even programming), and there is large demand
* ml has the potential to earn huge profits for companies
* there are operating costs (similar to resources i.e. electricity bill)
* you have to research constantly to stay at start of the art level
* time is valuable, especially to someone who has the ability to develop ml models. you have to invest lots (for free).
* not even including large expenses like insurance and taxes (if you are full time).

i think in general, there is a huge opportunity in the ml world. charging 20-40 bucks an hour just doesn't capture the opportunity cost (in my opinion) of running your own brand. i think to capture your opportunity and operating costs, you could easily multiply the hourly rate you expect to receive at a large company (\~40?) and multiply that by 2.5-3.5. in fact, i think that's what large companies do because you cost more than just your take home. i think a more reasonable price range would be 100$(beginner-intermediate)-200$(expert) hourly (as high as that sounds). frankly, i think it should be even more as i think working on personal projects or our own business would likely be a better long-term investment. it should take some serious cash to get us to spend time on some sponsors project.

maybe this is preaching to the choir, or i am a lunatic expecting way too much money. i think the bottom line is that there are some machine learning peoples out really undercutting their skills, and i would be interested if this community has noticed any trends in this regard.",62,3014,8,523

1,[D] Hybrid RNN model wins m4 forecasting competition,1,199,23,1529766707,"[d] hybrid rnn model wins m4 forecasting competition saw this in [r/statistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics) and thought it was pretty interesting. m4 is a pretty well regarded time series forecasting competition that has previously been very stats oriented. the github for the models is here:[https://github.com/m4competition/m4-methods](https://github.com/m4competition/m4-methods)  
i have taken [u/true\_believer](https://www.reddit.com/user/true_believer) 's post below:

[https://www.m4.unic.ac.cy/the-m-competitions-and-their-far-reaching-contributions-to-the-theory-and-practice-of-forecasting/](https://www.m4.unic.ac.cy/the-m-competitions-and-their-far-reaching-contributions-to-the-theory-and-practice-of-forecasting/)

* the  combination of methods was the king of the m4. of the 17 most accurate  methods, 12 were “combinations” of mostly statistical approaches.
* the  biggest surprise was a “hybrid” approach that utilised both statistical  and ml features. this method produced both the most accurate forecasts  and the most precise pis, and was submitted by slawek smyl, a data  scientist at uber technologies. according to smape, it was close to 10&#37;  more accurate than the combination benchmark.
* the  second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical  methods and an ml one, with the weights for the averaging calculated by  an ml algorithm that was trained to minimise the forecasting error  through holdout tests. this method was submitted jointly by spain’s  university of a coruña and australia’s monash university.
* the  most accurate and second most accurate methods also achieved an amazing  success in specifying the 95&#37; pis correctly. these are the first  methods we are aware of that have done so, rather than underestimating  the uncertainty considerably.
* the  six pure ml methods that were submitted in the m4 all performed poorly,  with none of them being more accurate than comb and only one being more  accurate than naïve2. this supports the findings of the latest plos one  paper by makridakis, spiliotis and assimakopoulos.

1,"[D] I could only find one machine learning wikia and it seemed pretty dead, do you think the community could benefit from a comprehensive wiki for devs, researchers, and people getting into the field?",1,35,21,1529625490,"[d] i could only find one machine learning wikia and it seemed pretty dead, do you think the community could benefit from a comprehensive wiki for devs, researchers, and people getting into the field? so i've noticed the wikipedia articles for machine learning are useful for giving you an idea of a topic but there's not much detail, for someone like me at least i would find a dedicated wikia for machine learning to be very useful, for instance look at this article for dbn

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep\_belief\_network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep_belief_network)

now compare it to the article for merge sort

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merge\_sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merge_sort)

while learning to program i didn't use wikipedia as a source much because other reliable info (in more digestible format) was available, but for machine learning the sources can be very unreliable and sometimes hard to come by.

for a couple of examples, last semester i did a lstm in numpy, all of the guides i could find were incomplete or wrong, focusing on the intuition and not the algorithms and code. one guide had a professional looking video to go along with it and with his code each back prop and feed forward took on average seventy four seconds. that is not what we should be teaching the kids. 

recently i was trying to do a gan in keras. i read the paper first and then looked through at least 10 implementations that all seemed wrong before learning in a comment thread keras was inflexible for this task and you needed to train it with tensorflow.

in the former case, a model definition and training algorithm in psuedo code like the merge sort article, and in the later case a note in the ""implementations"" section of an article would also have saved me a huge amount of time. 

then there's the problem of dissemination of research, it seems like stumbling across the paper / method relevant to you requires too much luck. 

then there's incomplete sources, research papers that leave out their model definitions, algorithms, data sets, and code. while it couldn't make up for what people leave out it could give you the accepted approach, corresponding data sets, and benchmarks against other methods. 

all in all it seems like we have a ton of information but it's scattered across the internet and difficult to access. ",200,2160,34,344

1,[D] Keys to compete against industry when in academia,1,71,36,1528836410,"[d] keys to compete against industry when in academia it seems from published papers that state\-of\-the\-art results are always coming out from industry, and that makes sense because of the much stronger compute power typically available in companies vs. universities. traditionally, it is somewhat expected that university researchers should focus more on ideas and concepts while industry researchers should consider large scale implementations. however, one observation at recent nips/icml/iclr/cvpr/etc.. papers reveals a common trend of showing off empirical results. this has haunted me several times and resulted in papers being rejected. it is just too hard to generate empirical results as awesome as those from industry. i hence focus on the more theoretical and algorithmic aspects, but it gets so frustrating when reviewers only critique the empirical results. my question is how to compete with industry in the era where empiricism is becoming so strong in machine learning?",53,934,9,139

many people have since tried to address the question of how/why/when generalization occurs (at least in the case of supervised learning generalizing to out-of-sample data), but no one has been able to answer the question without some caveats:
https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&sciodt=0,5&cites=4613672282544622621&scipsc=&q=&scisbd=1

(also, ferenc provides some context about caveats of current attempts at explaining generalization:
-http://www.inference.vc/sharp-vs-flat-minima-are-still-a-mystery-to-me/
-http://www.inference.vc/pruning-neural-networks-two-recent-papers/
-http://www.inference.vc/generalization-and-the-fisher-rao-norm-2/
-http://www.inference.vc/everything-that-works-works-because-its-bayesian-2/
)

as a result, the questions i’m trying to get any feedback on from r/ml are:
what do we currently know about generalization?
what should we be asking next about it?

the reason i’m asking these question is because there are still many scenarios where we struggle to achieve any generalization at all. the most notable scenarios are the inability of rl (& many popular generative models) to achieve out-of-sample generalization; for example, see [“a study on overfitting in deep reinforcement learning”] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06893)
the more far-out scenarios are the attempts to get low-shot out-of-distribution metalearning to work. for example, see videos of out-of-distribution generalization on ant navigation tasks in the videos at the bottom of blog post on evolved policy gradients:

this week two posts relating to machine learning were posted here one is about [how visual search works](https://thomasdelteil.github.io/visualsearch_mxnet/) and other about [generating ramen](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning/comments/8l5w56/p_generative_ramen/). the former post contains a small write up, source code and a demo site to explain how visual search works and the latter just have a gif of generated  ramen probably with a gan. the irony is that the post which has more information and source code for reproducing that work got only about 25 votes and the one with gif only with no source code or explanation provided got more than 1000 votes (not so unique work any one with basic understanding of gan can make one). today the most upvoted post here is about [a circle generating gan](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning/comments/8mgs8k/p_visualisation_of_a_gan_learning_to_generate_a/) which also has only a gif with brief explanation as comment and no source code. are you seeing a pattern here?

the problem i mentioned above is not a one of case, i am a regular lurker in this subreddit and for the past few months i started seeing some disturbing patterns in posts posted here. people who posts gif/movie/photo only post tends to get more upvotes than the posts with full source code or explanation.  i agree some original research posts [such as this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5p2bvfl44&feature=youtu.be&t=7s) can be only be released as videos and not a source code because of its commercial value. but most of the gif/movie/photo only posts here are not at all original research but they used a already know algorithm with a different dataset (eg: ramen generation). 

the problem here is if we continue this type of posts people will stop sharing their original works, source code or explanation and then starts sharing this type of end result only posts which will get less scrutiny and more votes. in future, this will not only decrease the quality of this subreddit but also its a greater danger to the open nature of machine learning field. what's the point in posting a github project link or blogpost here when we can get much more votes with a gif alone one?.

has got me thinking. a source code requirement would make this by far the most reproducible community in the history of experimental science. our experiments are programs that run *deterministically*. if you speak with other scientific communities about our reproducibility issues, they are baffled.

and let's be honest, any reason against doing so are from incentives that are misaligned with the idea of reproducible research (secrecy for competition, not enough time to submit to every conference).

this is our implementation of conditional improved wgan and improved wgan in pytorch. [https://github.com/jalola/improved\-wgan\-pytorch](https://github.com/jalola/improved-wgan-pytorch)

since this is our first\-time working on gans, it is harder than we thought. although the reference code are already available \([caogang\-wgan](https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp) in pytorch and [improved wgan](https://github.com/igul222/improved_wgan_training) in tensorflow\), the main part which is gan\-64x64 is not yet implemented in pytorch. 

we realize that training gan is really unstable. for instance, we stuck for one month and needed to test each component in our model to see if they are equivalent to their tf counterparts. this resulted in a small ""framework"" to compare tensorflow and pytorch modules \([compare\-tf\-to](https://github.com/jalola/compare-tensorflow-pytorch)\). in the end, it was just that we used batchnorm instead of layernorm :\) maybe it was just newbie mistake. 

since our previous post on this subreddit, we have added conditional wgan. it is a ""straightforward"" implementation as we have just added the auxiliary conditional part to the loss function and several accommodating changes to the input. 

we trained the models \(wgan and acwgan\) on a gtx\-1080ti \(which we bought 2 of them\) for more than 2 weeks \(100k iterations\). you can see the generated images here.

1,[D] Fake gradients for activation functions,1,147,54,1525357417,"[d] fake gradients for activation functions is there any theoretical reason that the error derivatives of an activation function have to be related to the exact derivative of that function itself?

this sounds weird, but bear with me. i know that activation functions need to be differentiable so that your can update your weights in the right direction by the right amount. but you can use functions that aren't purely differentiable, like relu which has an undefined gradient at zero. but you can _pretend_ that the gradient is defined at zero, because that particular mathematical property of the relu function is a curiosity and isn't relevant to the optimisation behaviour of your network. 

how far can you take this? when you're using an activation function, you're interested in two properties: its activation behaviour (or its feedforward properties), and its gradient/optimisation behaviour (or its feedbackward properties). is there any particular theoretical reason these two are inextricable?

say i have a layer that needs to have a saturating activation function for numerical reasons (each neuron needs to learn something like an inclusive or, and relu is bad at this). i can use a sigmoid or tanh as the activation, but this comes with vanishing gradient problems when weighted inputs are very high or very low. i'm interested in the feedforward properties of the saturating function, but not its feedbackward properties.

the strength of relu is that its gradient is constant across a wide range of values. would it be insane to define a function that is identical to the sigmoid, with the exception that its derivative is always 1? or is there some non-obvious reason why this would not work?

i've tried this for a toy network on mnist and it doesn't seem to train any worse than regular sigmoid, but it's not quite as trivial to implement on my actual tensorflow projects. and maybe a constant derivative isn't the exact answer, but something else with desirable properties. generally speaking, is it plausible to define the derivative of an activation to be some fake function that is not the actual derivative of that function?",43,2106,6,342

there are two reasons i'm asking this. first, there's so much stuff being done with dl that i wasn't really able to find much ""pure"" ml in any search results. arxiv and [arxiv sanity](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/) are swamped with neural nets and any google search as well, and even in this subreddit it feels like 98% of the content is dl. this is not a critique, and i might not be missing something, it's just an observation.

the main motivation asking for this is that i'm looking for a topic for my msc thesis, which could eventually unroll into a phd in ml (any tips for a topic are welcome). i've been enjoying reading books like bishop's prml, murphy's mlapp, etc. and overall enjoying the math behind ml. on the other hand, while i did like the dl book (by ian goodfellow, et.al.) it makes me wonder a bit if the non-convex optimization nature of neural nets doesn't make them a bit more engineering and bit less math. sure there is stuff like wgan and vaes which are more math based, but they feel more like an exception in the swamp of papers just showing different architectures and experiments. not saying there's anything wrong with it, just my feeling. feel free to prove me wrong.

tl;dr: how do you look for papers/research/projects in ml that don't involve neural nets? is there a keyword other than ""machine learning"" that captures the concept? ",85,1682,14,299

mu_t = alpha\*x_t + (1-alpha)\*mu_t-1,

 where mu is the exponential moving average. it seems like a simple 1 cell rnn should be able to easily and exactly approximate this. as you can see in [ this gist however](https://gist.github.com/hristobuyukliev/678152c504f5e917887c2fb1ea52778e) it very much does not. the closest thing i could get it to learn was some sort of random walk - i.e. predicting the previous value of x. even this behaviour is very rare and unstable. 

i tried using more layers/units (even though that's not the point), different learning rates, optimizers, rolled vs. unrolled version, different activations and initializations. not only is not the rnn not able to learn this simple function, but it often performs *very* poorly - e.g. the input data is between -10, +10, and it predicts values between 0 and -400. also, the activation is linear, so it should be very difficult/impossible to get stuck in local minima?

as part of a first-year cs project i've deployed an object detection model (mobilenet + ssd) running on a raspberry pi cpu. the overall detection performance + runtime performance (0.8~1.2 fps detection) was surprisingly good.

the use case was to identify users by their face and identify the object they were holding, if it belongs to one of two categories of recyclable trash. for this we hand labelled 1034 images. 

youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06dgkj8wyk0&feature=youtu.be

to make the video stream look more presentable we had multiple threads: one for the video capture, one for bounding box detection and one for the rendering of the latest frame + bounding box.

we applied transfer learning to a mobilenet with imagenet weights (aided mainly by https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo2) and then proceeded to deploy it on a raspberry pi with a heavily optimised image processing pipeline (as much as we can get with just python). i was expected sub 1fps performance + lousy detection so i was really pleased by what we managed to achieve (in addition to having to run a kivy gui. project requirement *rolls eye*) the raspberry pi is really an amazing device for the price and power requirements.

i was curious about how people make use of tensorflow and i would be glad if people reply to this thread with their own experiences.

for some context i use tf for quite some times now (2 years) and i have my own pipeline that evolved with the different releases  of tf. as of now i divided my process into three stages:

* 1. preprocess data into tfrecords file (specific to each projects) 
* 2. i have a custom parser that read json files and create network architecture, the loss to minimize and the training operation related (common to all project, only the json changes)
* 3. implement three function that train, evaluate and export the model. for each project i can use the same backbone and change only few part.

in this regard i was wondering how people use tensorflow (what does your pipeline looks like, how do you deploy your models, etc.). 

i run my training locally but will surely move on to google cloud platform. that's why i was wondering whether people use tf.estimator. for now i can't see what it would bring to my pipeline, but maybe i am not informed enough.

also for dataset, i found this to be very rigid, especially when you need to mix datasets. for instance i had a dataset with 20 classes and have proper balanced batches was a nightmare with tf.dataset api only so i had to mix everything beforehand. how do you go to shuffle properly your data?

if you have a concept you would like to obtain more papers about, post it here (along with all papers you already found on said concept) and we'll help you find them. 

i've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented  very similar concepts in a previous paper. 

even the google brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. a few months ago they released a paper of swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it. 

>as has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. the fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough enough literature search. my sincere apologies. we will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.

so post a topic/idea/concept, along with all the papers you already found on it, and we'll help you find more. 

even if you weren't thinking about looking for one in particular, it doesn't hurt to check if you missed anything. post your concept anyway. 

here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

i might do a round 2 of this in a week or two depending on how much free time i have, with a much better format i planned out. 

anyone who participates in this post will have priority if they have a paper by then.

dl@jeju is a one-month program to learn deep learning techniques and implement your ideas together with your mentors at a beautiful place, jeju island, korea. dl@jeju is sponsored by google, kakao, netmarble and sk telecom.

please first have a look how fun it was in the last year event.

[photos - dl@jeju in 2017] https://photos.google.com/share/af1qipnjsus8-wqbnyjrq6k2tajcs1bt68xbqqdaqtgimnquupekyzhvjvyqbdcpdoubqa?key=ndvhvlpavwdutllrbxh2zen5qkp4aup4tkhkqvzb

dl@jeju is not a summer school where the participants just take lectures, but a hackathon-like camp where the participants set their own goals and achieve them with a collaboration with other participants and mentors. after the camp, you will have an arxiv publication and codes on github as the achievement of the research from the camp.

we are hosting from 20 to 30 participants in this year as (in the last year). all participants will be provided accommodations, 1000usd stipends and a part of the flight support (up to 300usd). we believe that you will have unforgettable summer days in jeju with great friends and great achievements. the friendly city jeju does not require visa for most international visitors to stay up to 30 days. thus, don't worry about it, but just apply it for your summer and your future.

if you're having trouble with a particular paper, post it with the parts you are having trouble with, and hopefully me or someone else may help out. it'll be like a mini study group to extract as much valuable info from each paper. 

even if it's a paper that you're not per say totally stuck on, but it's just that it'll take a while to completely figure out, post it anyway in case you find some value in shaving off some precious time in pursuing the total comprehension of that paper, so that you can more quickly move onto other papers.

1,"[D] How to encourage competition and prevent ""working together"" in genetic algorithms",1,23,30,1523187094,"[d] how to encourage competition and prevent ""working together"" in genetic algorithms i got bored tonight and decided to write a genetic algorithm for [dupl.io](https://dupl.io/), curious to know if there's any way to ""get better"" or if it's just a matter of wasting a bunch of time.

how the game works:

> you can select any tile you own every second, and this will increment it. once it hits 5, it will take ownership of the 4 adjacent tiles, increment them, and remove ownership of the current tile. you can take over other land with this. score is determined by the count of each tile added together.

the way i approached this was to rewrite the game, set up neural networks in a genetic setting, inputs are a 7x7 grid around each tile (3 times: 0/1 for on the grid or not, count/4 for own tile, and count/4 for enemy tile, effectively creating 7*7*3 inputs). for a given tile owner, i parse each 7x7 grid, get a ""score"", and the tile with the highest score is selected to upgrade/expand.

******

so, unfortunately, the way i handled this was by dumping 20 of them (in grid formation, but randomly sorted) into a 41x41 grid and waited 500 ticks and did my genetic reproduction magic. this meant, however, that what took over is an ""always go left"", because whoever spawns on the left-most side will eat up everybody, and everybody else will ""surrender"" (i presume if i left it running long enough, it will also develop a ""go down afterwards""), **maximizing the fittest, but not the average**.

so, what could a solution be? i could put each agent against bots so they have no impact on each other, but then they just learn to exploit the pre-written bots and not necessarily improve beyond the bots. i could also have them run live, on the site, however that would take much, much longer.

i feel like this would apply to tons of other situations as well, like chess. if a bot does well enough on white to take over a population, it could have a mutation that makes it always forfeit as black. this would cause that agent to win even more, and then reproduce even more.

p.s. i don't know if this is unrelated, but if they're all playing each other, how could you see improvements anyway? the fitness score might even go down as they improve and get on equal footing. i've tried to look at stats like ""tiles claimed"" or ""tiles stolen"" as an indication of whether or not they're getting better, but i'm having no luck.

edit: another solution could be to split up my population of 20 into four populations of 5, so something that takes over in one could only ""control"" a quarter of the total population.",85,2526,12,449

1,[D] Self-teaching more advanced math required for ML/DL research,1,137,46,1522954772,"[d] self-teaching more advanced math required for ml/dl research i just started doing my masters in ai this year after finishing a cs bachelor, and am intending to most likely continue on with a phd in ml/dl (if i can). the problem is, now that i'm finally getting deep into studying ml/dl materials i'm finding that my math skills are really not good enough.

to give a specific example, i just started reading [machine learning: a probabilistic perspective](https://www.amazon.com/machine-learning-probabilistic-perspective-computation/dp/0262018020). prior to picking this up, i also looked at the wildly praised bishop's pattern recognition and the elements of statistical learning, but it felt that the book i picked best matched the things i don't know about / want to learn.

but just as i'm working through the probability refresher chapter, i'm starting to feel my usual ""i should know more about this"" feeling. to be extra specific, just the mention of student's/laplace/gamma/beta distributions are something i never experienced in my previous studies. or things like multi-variate distributions. or even something like hypothesis testing is something that was almost untouched during my undergrad.

to give another example, i've been trying to catch up on the recent dl papers and most of the time i don't have trouble with the math, but last week i was reading the wasserstein gan paper and just a mention of lipschitz continuity makes me feel like a first year undergrad.

there are many more things i could list, but you probably get the general idea.

to put this in more perspective, my undergrad was quite math-ish, yet there are things that clearly weren't covered, or they were and i have no intuition of them. there also aren't really any more courses i can take that teach more of the advanced stuff without actually taking classes with the math majors at a different faculty.

the reason i'm saying all of this, is that i can't really imagine myself finishing my thesis next year and going into a phd where it might be expected of me to write a paper like the wgan one.

i'm not sure how this compares to us, though i asked my professor at a deep learning seminar and he basically said that he knows of one university in switzerland that teaches dl with lots of applied theory, and that otherwise there isn't really any course i can take to learn the more advanced stuff in probability / linear algebra / calculus.

for example, in my two probability courses we covered stuff like basic probability theory, and then moved on to markov chains, bits of queue theory, bits of poisson processes. but looking at the ml: a prob perspective book, it feels as if i had only taken the most basic probability theory. in linear algebra, we did all the basic stuff, all the fun decompositions (svd, qr, lu), eigenvalues, orthogonal matrices, etc., but we didn't touch any vector calculus, and i don't really have any intuition for any of the more advanced stuff, other than understanding the definitions/proofs. as for calculus, we kinda ended with lagrange multipliers and did a bit about theory of metric spaces, but again, reading most of the papers, i feel like knowing what a jacobian is is the only useful thing i know.

any tips on how i should continue? what books to read? what online courses to take? what videos to watch?",64,3278,9,546

i have a french engineering degree (equivalent to an msc), majored in datascience and robotics, and an other masters in applied math on top of it and i am really struggling to find work in an ai lab. i've been working as a datascience consultant for a year now in one of the biggest/best datascience consulting outfits in paris, thinking wrongly that the technical/theoretical level would be higher than it is. i am doing really basic regressions in r and pumping out powerpoint presentations.

i've been trying for the last 3 months to find positions in any company that claims to have an ai research division. the problem is for smaller companies, i found that most offers with ai in the title are basically doing what my consulting firm does, use ai and datascience as buzzwords to upsell themselves. i really do not want to change jobs only to do basic stuff and powerpoint presentations. and for the big ones, the few positions i come across for which i know the company really does research (google, fb and co) i haven't been able to go past the hr phone interview (i have applied worldwide). seeing as these positions ask for phds or mscs, my questions would be:

1. considering my background and experience, am i deluded in thinking i have a shot at the big ones ?
2. if i don't have a shot, why? is it because of a lack of education ? the perceived quality of my education (not stanford or mit) ? is it because i pigeonholed myself in a consulting job ?
3. what should i do to maximize my chances, should i go back to academia and get a phd ? should i work in an ai startup to wash away the consultant stigma/ build my public github (can't really share what i'm doing as a consultant) ? ",26,1745,8,320

i'm trying to research if there is an actual demand for this kind of data.
     
the data has been cleaned up and transformed so that it is uniform across different countries.
it contains matches from annual cup competitions in each country plus the main league and second-tier, third-tier leagues for major countries.

as you can see in this [diagram](https://imgur.com/p85vol5) there are a couple of tables:

 * using the match.id you can connect to the rest of the tables and obtain extra information about the home / away team.
 * league statistics contains a snapshot of the league table before the game was played
 * last matches contain the 10 last matches played by the home / away team per each id.

here's some of my questions:

 * do you think i could commercialize this data?
 * if you are interested in this data how much would you be willing to pay (0$ is a valid option) for a daily updated database?
 * would sqlite be a format you can work with or do you prefer something else?

thanks for the help!

machine learning research has always involved quite a bit of engineering, but we (seem to be) at the point where a large fraction of papers consist of a search in the space of architectures, usually combining previous successful approaches to do even better on some benchmark, with some hand-wavy explanations to support the method.
this seems forgivable for papers coming out of industry--after all, there the ultimate goal is to improve some metric and understanding is secondary, but it seems that ""it achieves state of the art results, qed"" has replaced ""here's a rigorous investigation into why we believe this method works"".

the other issue is that it seems like even if you write a good paper about some method you've developed that achieves sota on some task, it's likely been done in industry already and you're just reinventing the wheel.  when i come up with a new architecture for some task, i can't help but thinking that:

* some smart software engineer at big tech firm x has probably already done this and it's in production
* a software engineer with a good amount of experience in ml engineering *could* have come up with this, just wouldn't have written a paper on it
* since this is going to be outdated in a few months anyway, my thesis is going to be full of outdated architectures

video : https://youtu.be/8qerxvu38rs


i'd like to showcase my ongoing project, that is, a small scale autonomous electric car. i've used a pi camera along with a raspberry pi 3. since the pwm on pi wasn't enough, i also added a pca9685 motor driver onto the car for steering and throttle. 

here's a test video ( https://youtu.be/8qerxvu38rs ) of the car on a two lane road with some decent turns and straight paths! 

any feedback is appreciated! ",59,464,11,77

1,[D] Does most research in ML overfit to the test set in some sense?,1,59,34,1520061668,"[d] does most research in ml overfit to the test set in some sense? i know the rule is that you should first divide the whole dataset into train/dev/test splits. then lock the test split in a safe place. do whatever you want with the train and dev splits (e.g., training on the train split using gradient descent, picking the hyper-parameters on the dev split, ...). only after you satisfy with your model's performance on the dev set, you finally evaluate your model on the test set.

now suppose you are a researcher working on question answering (e.g, squad, mctest, wikiqa, ...), and one day you come up with a new idea of a new model for qa. you train and fine-tune your model on the train and dev splits. finally after months of hard work, you decide to test your beautiful model on the test split. and it gave very bad result. what do you do next?

+ quit working on this and don't care about this forever.

+ decide to find a way to improve this original idea / decide to try a new idea. and then repeat the above process. but then if you follow this approach, didn't you rely on the test set to give you the signal that the original idea did not work well in this case? in some sense, you peeked at the test set to know which approaches work and which don't.

i started thinking about this when i realized that for few experiments i unconsciously printed out both the scores on the dev split and the test split. this broke the rule mentioned above. but then when i read some paper about a model that has dozen of components, i would imagine that if the researchers follow the rule, then they first spend a lot of time implementing all the components. after that, they tested the model on the test set. if the result is good, then they write papers. if not then ???

i would love to hear some opinions on this as i am a new phd student working on ml.",67,1790,14,333

1,[D] Which is your favorite Machine Learning algorithm?,1,131,113,1519465327,"[d] which is your favorite machine learning algorithm? my current favorite is spectral clustering. it is sort of the flagship algorithm for a whole class of methods called spectral algorithms[1], which have been gaining increasing attention from the ml community in recent years.

why is it my favorite? because it brings together some of the most fascinating areas of mathematics in an interesting way. i’ve never seen an algorithm combine so many ideas and insights from seemingly disparate fields.

so, what is spectral clustering?

it is an algorithm for detecting communities among a network of entities (users in a social network, pixels in an image, gene expressions etc.). the goal is to partition the entities into groups such that entities of the group are similar while the entities of different groups are not similar.

how does spectral clustering work?

first, we construct a similarity matrix from the given network (or graph). then we extract the most relevant eigenvectors of the similarity matrix using eigenvalue decomposition and use it to derive a new ‘spectral’ representation for the entities in our network. finally, we perform k-means on the new representation and output the clusters.


to be honest, the first time i came across spectral clustering, i had no idea why this method should give a nice partition of the network . there’s just too much going on, and it definitely is not intuitive at the first glance. but if you stick with it and dig a little deeper, you begin to see some surprising connections. here, i’ll just try to list a few tidbits about spectral clustering to pique your curiosity.

graph cuts: it is a well known fact that finding the balanced minimum cut of a graph is an np hard problem[2] . it turns out that spectral clustering solves a continuous relaxation of this discrete combinatorial optimization problem.
random walks: consider a random walk on a graph[3] . at each time step, the random walker jumps from the current vertex to any of its neighbors randomly. it turns out that spectral clustering minimizes the inter-cluster transit time (the time spent walking between the clusters rather than within the clusters) of the random walker.
physics: spectral clustering has surprising connections to the laplacian operator[4] that is widely used in physics as a measure of smoothness of a surface.
graph signal processing[5] : consider a graph signal on the given network that distinctly identifies the best possible clustering of its vertices. spectral clustering minimizes the total variation of this indicator graph signal.
matrix perturbation theory: consider an ideal similarity matrix constructed by a graph with disjoint clusters. it turns out that perturbing this idea matrix by adding a ‘few’ edges across the clusters does little to change the spectral representation of the vertices. hence, spectral clustering works, and is immune to ‘noise’.

..and i could go on and on. unlike the hottest machine learning algorithms these days (neural networks and deep learning) which are basically black boxes where no one understands why something works, spectral methods have strong theoretical grounding with several interpretations on why they work. i like to think of spectral clustering as a well written poem that means different things to different people while being elegant all the same.

i'd like to know if there are some data science/machine learning engineers who are working at the intersection between engineering and machine learning. regardless of the title used, these engineers are the ones who enjoy doing research, playing with data, at the same time building end-to-end in-production solutions. i would imagine that it would be easier to distinguish these engineers in companies like openai/microsoft research/fb research, but there is a rising need to have this type of  engineers in data-focused companies. 

i would like to know how these people built their profiles:

- how do distinguish a research/data science/machine learning engineer from a sde/be engineer: do these engineers focus on improving their technical skills (open sourcing projects, having strong github profile, .. etc) or having strong record of publications. 

- if you are one, how did you get the job ? how did they evaluate you (focus more on algorithms or ml theory ? ).
 
- if you are a recruiter, a research lead, a manager or a startup cto, what is your advise for an aspiring research/data science/machine learning engineer ?. do i need to focus on publishing some papers, or do i need to start a blog and open source/showcase more technical projects.

 if you can share some insights that would be helpful. i couldn't find a description of this profile that put together, most people talk about data scientist (who are not supposed to build production-ready solutions ) or data engineers (who are focusing on etl pipelines). engineers in research labs are most probably phds or research associates. however, this profile of engineers can be easily found in ai-first companies like openai, deepmind, .. etc

i have a dream.  i run a local cleanup group that focuses on collecting nails from burnt pallets and other waste at our river.  this is a major problem.  so far i have picked up 6,500lbs of nails.  i have built 2 magnetic sweepers.  they are custom built with the strongest magnets possible.  so here is the dream:  when the nails hit the stainless steel tray ((the bottom)(the magnets sit in side the tray and swings out to drop the nails from the bottom)  they make a very distinctive sound.  once the tray has been saturated with nails the sounds dissipate.  it is then time to dump the nails in collection pile.  this is very labor intensive volunteer work.  it is easy to identify hot spots of nails due to the sound it makes clanging against the tray. is this type of audio input good enough to train an ai to cover a large area and identify nail hot spots? the robot part seems easy enough... its the training the ai that has me lost.  is there anyone who might have ideas on how i can do this or help with the project?  once it works on one then we can scale it up.  illegal dumping and pallet burning is a nation wide issue that caused countless flat tires, injuries to wildlife and pets.

1,"[D] Eat Your VGGtables, or, Why Does Neural Style Transfer Work Best With Old VGG CNNs' Features?",1,123,30,1516469834,"[d] eat your vggtables, or, why does neural style transfer work best with old vgg cnns' features? > previous: [twitter](https://twitter.com/gwern/status/954162305528483840) [discussion](https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/954173051330904065).

an acquaintance a year or two ago was messing around with neural style transfer ([gatys et al 2016](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/gatys_image_style_transfer_cvpr_2016_paper.pdf ""image style transfer using convolutional neural networks"")), experimenting with some different approaches, like a tile-based gpu implementation for making large poster-size transfers, or optimizing images to look different using a two-part loss: one to encourage being like the style of the style image, and a negative one to penalize having content like the source image; this is unstable and can diverge, but when it works, looks cool. (example: [""the great wave"" + golden gate bridge](https://68.media.tumblr.com/9e3b73ea6c2fb0348d75a77dcf5af168/tumblr_ots4zgw3ce1uy4j3wo1_1280.jpg). i tried further [klimt-ising it](https://deepart.io/img/tmn8gqf61/) but at that point too much has been lost.)

## vgg worked best for style transfer

one thing they noticed was that using features from a pretrained [imagenet vgg-16/19 cnn](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556 ""'very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition', simonyan & zisserman 2014"") from 2014 (4 years ago), like the original gatys paper did, worked much better than anything else; indeed, almost any set of 4-5 layers in vgg would provide great features for the style transfer optimization to target (as long as they were spread out and weren't exclusively bottom or top layers), while using more modern resnets (resnet-50) or googlenet inception v1 didn't work - it was hard to find sets of layers that would work at all and when they did, the quality of the style transfer was not as good.
interestingly, this appeared to be true of vgg cnns trained on the [mit places scene recognition database](http://places.csail.mit.edu/) too, suggesting there's something architectural going on which is not database specific or peculiar to those two trained models.
and their attempt at an upscaling cnn modeled on [johnson et al 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155 ""perceptual losses for real-time style transfer and super-resolution"")'s vgg-16 for cifar-100 worked well too.

## everyone uses vgg

indeed, vgg is used pervasively through style transfer implementations & research beyond what one would expect from cargo-culting or copy-paste, even in applications as exotic as inferring images from human fmri scans ([shen et al 2017](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/30/240317 ""deep image reconstruction from human brain activity"")).
this surprising because 4 years in dl is a long time, and the newer cnns outperform vgg at everything else like image classification or object localization ([tapa ghosh](https://twitter.com/semidl/status/954173261436239873) disagrees on object localization) rendering vgg obsolete due to its large model size (much of which comes from the 3 large fully-connected layers at the top) & slowness & poor accuracy, and style transfer itself has made major advances in, among other things, going from days on a desktop to generate a new image to being capable of realtime on smartphones. for example, [squeezenet](https://github.com/lizeng614/squeezenet-neural-style-pytorch) outperforms vgg in every way, but its style transfer results are distinctly worse (but extremely fast!). although this vgg-specificity appears to be folklore among practitioners, this is not something i have seen noticed in neural style transfer papers; indeed, the review [jing et al 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04058 ""neural style transfer: a review"") explicitly says that other models work fine, but their reference is to [johnson's list of models](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style/wiki/using-other-neural-models) where almost every single model is (still) vgg-based and the ones which are not come with warnings (nin-imagenet: ""may need heavy tweaking to achieve reasonable results""; illustration2vec: ""best used with anime content...be warned that it can sometimes be difficult to avoid the burn marks that the model sometimes creates""; pascal voc fcn-32s: ""uses more resources than vgg-19, but can produce better results depending on your style and/or content image."" etc). 

## hypotheses

some possible explanations:

1. vgg is so big that it is incidentally capturing a lot of information that the other models discard and accidentally generalizing better despite worse task-specific performance. (do resnets in general do transfer-learning worse, compared to earlier cnns, than would be expected based on their superior task-specific performance?)

    but while vgg is giant compared to other imagenet models, 500m vs <50mb ([keras table](https://keras.io/applications/#documentation-for-individual-models)), most of this appears to be coming from the fc layers rather than the convolutions being sampled (leaving 58/80mb for the rest), so where is the supposed knowledge being stored? nor does vgg appear to have tame internal dynamics lacking in other models - the layer average norms differ greatly, and rescaling appears to be unnecessary (neither they nor johnson needed to do that like the bethge lab did).

    on the gripping hand, could the fc layers in some way be forcing the lower convolutions to be different in terms of abstractions than equivalent convolutions in later less-fc-heavy models?
2. resnets are unrolled iteration/shallow ensembles: the features do exist but they are too spread out to be pulled out easily and the levels of abstraction are all mixed up - instead of getting a nice balance of features from the bottom and top, they're spread out wildly between layer #3 and #33 and #333 etc. while vggs, being relatively shallow and modular and having no residual connections or other special tricks to smuggle raw information up the layers, are forced to create more of a clearcut hierarchical pyramid of abstractions.

    here there may be some straightforward way to better capture resnet knowledge; [pierre richemond](https://twitter.com/kloudstrife/status/954313424103727105) suggestions

    > probably resnets feature maps need to be summed depthwise before taking the gram matrix. by that logic, one'd think densenets should work better than resnets but worse than vgg (due to gradient flows from earlier layers).
3. residual connections themselves somehow mess up the optimization procedure by affecting properties like independence of features, with ""blurring"" from layers so easily passing around activations, suggests [kyle kastner](https://twitter.com/kastnerkyle/status/954174828881305602) (this might be the same thing as ""resnets have too many layers & split up features"")
4. vgg's better performance is due to not downsampling aggressively, doing so only after two convolutions and then max pooling

    in this interpretation, googlenet fails because it downsamples in the first layer.

### testing hypotheses

what tests could be done?

1. train much bigger resnet/densenets to see if expanding model capacity helps; alternately, retrain much smaller vggs to create models which are comparable in parameters to see if the gap goes away. if a small vgg can't do better style transfer than an equal-sized resnet, that suggests there is no special mystery.

    add/remove fc layers from retrained vgg and resnet models. does that lead to large gains/losses in quality?
2. experiment with different ways of picking or summing layers to generate features; possibly brute force, trying out a large number of subsets until one works.

    another approach would be to try to remove layers entirely: resnets are resistant to deleting random layers, or one could try model distillation to train a shallow but wide resnet from a sota deep resnet. with similar parameters, it should perform just as well, but the layer features should be more compressed and easier to find a good set.
3. model distillation again but for an equivalent resnet minus all residual connections? i don't know if that's trainable at all.
4. train competing models but with vgg-style initial layers.

fixing this limitation to vgg, or showing that current resnets actually do work well and this folklore is false, could speed up style transfer training by replacing vgg with a smaller faster model, or a better one, and might give some interesting insights into what cnns are learning & how that's affected by their architecture.",97,8552,17,1208

with regular data (n > p), you use vif which solves the problem nicely, but in the n << p case, vif won't work since the formula has 1 - r_squared in the denominator and that will be zero in the n << p case. and you cannot use a correlation matrix because it is possible for collinearity to exist between 3 or more variables even if no pair of variables has a particularly high correlation.

the only solution i've ever come across is using dimensionality reduction to compress the predictor space to n > p, then do vif (although am not sure how you would map back to the original predictor space to drop the offending predictors). perhaps there is a better way someone knows about?",50,909,6,160

1,[D] Is there any bottleneck with online reinforcement learning that makes it not mainstream yet?,1,16,25,1516048984,"[d] is there any bottleneck with online reinforcement learning that makes it not mainstream yet? online learning may refer to the ones with batch size to be 1, but here i mean online reinforcement learning is the rl where the agent is updated at every timestep. 

naively speaking, the concept of online reinforcement learning sounds very much like how human learns, and it's very effective for tasks like stochastic games. since it performs an update at each timestep, the agent may be more robust under the circumstances such that the current state is relatively unfamiliar. as it was updated in the past ten or so timesteps which are close to the current timesteps, the agent is more adapted to the unfamiliar current states. also, the weights of the agent may be considered to be conditioned on the past events in the same episode, which may alleviate the issue of lstm and memory network, that is, they still has the limit on the extent to which they can remember the distant past events in the same episode. furthermore, being able to update online probably makes the agent more sample-efficient, since they can be improved midst an episode that may contribute to a better subsequent performance in the same episode. the sparse reward issue may be dealt with by reward designing (which is essentially the simulator for reward only without relying on the presence of (sub)optimal agent). with this, alphazero-like mcts may be used for orl.  

below, let's consider the continual case (a single episode with very large horizon) only, as a repetition of small horizon tasks like pong can be cast to this case. the agent needs a large experience buffer d, to which we store most events observed so far. at each timestep, we obtain (s,a,r), store it to d, form a minibatch by sampling (s,a,r)'s from d and then update once. note of the following:

- the sampling should favor the recent events over the past ones and the interesting events over the uninteresting ones (events with larger magnitude of reward over the smaller ones, or you can concurrently train a nn to quantify interestingness of (s,a,r)).   

- i believe the causality information should somehow be incorporated in this online learning, and the recalled information should be causally concentrated. note that states, actions and interestingness of (s,a,r) pairs in a small neighborhood of timestep t tend to be similar to each other. for example, a minibatch may consist of sub-minibatches like [(s^t , a^t , r^t , t),(s^t+1 , a^t+1 , r^t+1 , t+1),...(s^t' , a^t' , r^t' , t')], where the last component t conveys the causality information to be utilized in the loss function.

- the recent events are extremely important, so (s,a,r,t) of the past 50 or so timesteps should be always be in a part of the minibatch to be updated on.

this way, the batch isn't too small, and the agent isn't overfitted to the recent events. so anyway, what makes orl not mainstream? are the currently prominent benchmarks not useful for orl?

a simple example is, for a movie review is this:  imagine a movie review was *this movie was good*.  the simplest way to make this sentence a negative review might be  *this movie was* **not** *good*.  i'm curious on how others may want to set up this problem.

i made a melanoma diagnosis model named ""model melanoma"" based on deep learning algorithm (http://melanoma.modelderm.com).


resnet152 and vgg19 were used as a cnn model, around 300,000 images (179 classes) were used as a training dataset.


the auc (area under curve) value of this model is 0.9476 (using melanoma output/nevus output ratio) and 0.9340 (using melanoma output) with all the 407 melanocytic (76 malignant, 331 benign) test images of the edinburgh dermofit library (https://licensing.edinburgh-innovations.ed.ac.uk/i/software/dermofit-image-library.html).
for reference, the skin cancer detection model published on nature(https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21056) showed 0.96 with 225 melanocytic (58 malignant, 167 benign) test images of the edinburgh dermofit library.


the web-based test platform provides a miss rate or false negative rate (1-sensitivity) in the diagnosis of melanoma. 

in addition, we made 176 skin diseases diagnosis model (http://modelderm.com) and onychomycosis diagnosis model (http://nail.medicalphoto.org). the diagnostic accuracy of the onychomycosis model was better than 42 dermatologists we tested (the manuscripts are under review).

i hope the cnn would help to screening melanoma. thank you.",60,1254,5,157

1,[D] Planing a Python library that hosts/formats all ML Datasets.,1,28,22,1513564071,"[d] planing a python library that hosts/formats all ml datasets. hi, i am planing a python library that hosts (ideally) all ml datasets.

the goal is that you can do all of the following with one line of code each:

-search for a dataset

-get information on a dataset and all the available formats

-download and initialize the dataset

-set the format (e.g. of the output batches)

-get a training/test/validation batch (depending on the format)

-do pre/post-processing dependent on the format

this is the basic idea, if you know of something already in existence i would love to know about it. but all i could find are some github repos that have wrappers for some specific datasets.

what i want to achieve with this post is to get a general sense if this is something the community would actually need or if it is just me. and getting a rough idea of the whole picture and of what it would take to make this useful. and if someone would like to collaborate with me on this.

workflow example: lets say i have a project where i want to generate song lyrics and for that i have a dataset of 100k songs. i had to download that dataset manually after quite a bit of searching and when i finally had it, i needed to clean it up and format it in a usable way. and lastly, i have to write a dataset loading, augmentation and batching library to go along with it. finally the model can be trained! but wait, there is a new paper out describing a new type of model (maybe a lstm2.0 based, recurrent model with state of the art... blablabla) that i have to try to see if my results will improve. now let's suppose that my original model took in the raw vectorized characters of the song lyrics and the new model takes in the whole vectorized words. this has to be adjusted, so except for the training, the majority of time spend on testing out the new model goes into rewriting my original dataset loading library or maybe even reformatting the whole data and adjusting my pre and post processing steps to fit the new format.

the idea is that you can visit the project website and search for a dataset by category, keyword, etc. or do that directly from the python terminal using the lib ""libx.search(keywords='nlp,lyrics,songs')"". then when you want more details on the dataset and the different formations of it (vectorized characters/vectorized words/etc.) you have something like ""libx.dataset_info(dataset_name='100k_rap_lyrics_v1')"" that would return a dictionary of information, you get it. download and initialize it, ""dataset = libx.init_dataset(dataset_name='100k_rap_lyrics_v1',path='./dataset/path')"" maybe you could also pass in a configuration parameter to e.g. specify how much memory it should take up, or if the whole thing should be loaded into memory, and if it should be split into training, test and validation sets and the percentages of samples for each of these (probably a good default would be required). then you can set up your formation like this ""dataset.set_format(dataset.formats.vectorized_words,options={""vector_size"":10000,""pre_word_count"":8})"". that would set the format of the dataset and input output correlations returned by ""dataset.get_batch(..."". so when you write ""x,y = dataset.get_batch(batch_size=128)"" x and y would be the input and the desired output, in this case x would have this shape: [batch_size, per_word_count,vector_size] and y: [batch_size,vector_size]. more useful stuff; in pre-processing when you want to convert a sentence into a vector array ""dataset.to_vector('my sentence.')"" or back ""dataset.to_words([word_count,vector_size])"". if you would like to run it after training, ""sentence='this is the beginning'"" ""result = model.run(dataset.to_vector(sentence,length=pre_word_count))"" ""sentence += dataset.to_words(result)[0]"".

it is very important that you have a generalized set of formations, different sentence based datasets should have the same formations available to them. all word/sentence based datasets have formations for text generation, classification, sentiment analysis, etc. the same goes for something like mnist, there you would have formats for classification,generation, etc.

i realize that this is very massive project and my plan is to make it a github based open source effort. i am sorry for the extend of this post. i don't write many posts on reddit so some tips and tricks are very welcome.",64,4314,10,669

1,[D] Training with Batch Normalization,1,22,33,1512893574,"[d] training with batch normalization hi, despite all the alchemy which batch norm does behind the covariate shift , i understand it simply as normalization layer which tries to keep all activation within some prior distribution. this is especially helpful at the beginning of the training process where badly chosen initialization may lead to vanishing or exploding signal in the network. once the network is trained the batch norm in test time uses moving averages of estimated mean and variance of training population i.e. it applies simple linear transformation. so here are the questions which come to my mind:

* did anyone try to compare estimated values of mean and variance, with those computes from whole training set (i.e. not by moving averages)? i'm wonder how this would affect test accuracy. additionally, how sure can we be that those estimates are optimal for test performance?

* secondly, once the network is trained, why don't we replace batch norm with linear transformation of form: bn(x) = gamma * x + beta, with gamma/beta being parameters used during test time and then fine tune them using regular gradient descent approach? 

i just wanted to ask experts here, before i will waste a few hours of my life on trying things which already have been done.

however, do you know of any papers that explored the performance differences between plain regression loss functions and converting to a classification problem? 
or, more generally, papers that analyze shortcomings of a l2 loss in a way that implies that avoiding it might be beneficial?

i read the pixelrnn paper ([pdf] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06759.pdf)), where they did something similar and am inclined to just reference it, but it seems a bit thin to just point to one paper, where this was beneficial too.
