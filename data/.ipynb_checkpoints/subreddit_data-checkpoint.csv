Is diverse work experience a profitable career path?,"I am a mechanical engineer by degree, 7 years out of college. In my career so far, I feel that I have accumulated a fairly broad range of work experience: mechanical design, field service/installation, testing, machining, electrical design, mechanical/electrical assembly, control system design, PLC programming. My current role is in a small company doing 100% of the design work, start to finish, of automated manufacturing systems (as the sole engineer). On top of this, I do the majority of assembly and testing, and machine a good number of my parts for prototyping.

My question comes down to this: is a diverse range of work experience considered valuable to employers in a way that can make my career more profitable?

Advice needed - Stressful Engineering Job!,"\*\*LONG RANT\*\* \*\*APOLOGIES FOR THE NEGATIVITY IN THE POST\*\*

Where do I even begin to describe my situation? I currently work at an F500 company as an entry-level design and validation engineer. This is my first job after graduating from grad school. My work hours were crazy until I made a decision myself to limit myself from working more than 50 hours a week. My team's design lead had to email everybody in the team to work only during the normal working time and not during nights and weekends, which is working I believe. At first, I didn't mind working long hours to get myself acquainted with the company and its various processes and systems, but it started affecting my mental health. The deadlines are extremely tight and the pressure is extreme to make things happen. My direct manager also left the company within a year citing health reasons, long hours, and high stress. 

Working from home and after \~7 months of joining the company, I still feel uncomfortable with my day-to-day activities. It mostly consists of giving updates on my components in system-level meetings. And I'm so busy gathering information for my updates, I just don't find the time to learn in-depth about the components that I'm owning for the product/ other essential skills like GD&amp;T, stackups, other analyses, etc. I feel like I'm flying blind sometimes. I don't even get the time to read standards/best practices. 

I also suffer from high anxiety and I'm currently seeking therapy and that is helping (it's been only 2 months since I started). I strongly think that my anxiety plays a huge role in my work and personal life, I hesitate to ask basic questions to understand better and feel like a non-contributor for my team. I mess up in planning and still do, as compared to my colleagues. My colleagues who are younger than me are much more organized and detail-oriented. My work so far is always a mess and I always feel like I will be fired tomorrow. I struggle with prioritizing tasks and collaborating with people on my team. I don't want them to think that they made a mistake in hiring me. 

I want to get better at my job and I am really looking for some guidance from veterans in this group. Thank you! I would like to apologize if the tone of this post is negative, but it has been on my mind for a long time.",AskEngineers,1645504664

I get that if I had a divider in the vessel instead of it shrinking then the pressure wouldn’t change but isn’t shrinking the container changing the size? I googled some answers and this nasa like I found 

https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/BGH/pressure.html

Taking a job at a large company,"Hi all,

1. They offered me the position with no interview simply based on my resume. I'm early career so I'm not at a place where I'm specialized / valuable enough to be just be offered jobs without an interview.

2. I asked to speak with the hiring manager for the position, which they kindly facilitated. The HM seemed great, but was unable to tell me which specific team I would be assigned. This gave me the impression that the company is just hiring engineers left and right without as much thought as I'd like to see.

3. No timeline for the contract. I asked what the timeline was and they said it could be up to two years but weren't able to give me a specific time. 

I'm torn the job seems good in terms of pay / career development but I'm concerned this company is hiring engineers without really putting enough thought into the process. Further if the company experienced a rough financial quarter I'm concerned they'd lay me off without much thought as well.

First of all I'd like to say that I do not have much experience. I may forget to ask certain questions in this post and every advice would be welcome. 

I am looking forward to building a high pressure homogenizer for personal use. Being on a budget, I am wondering if building a homogenizer from spare parts may be cheaper than buying one directly.

Operating pressure: 30,000 psi

Flow rate: 0.5 l/min

Pump system: Hydraulic unit system 

Inlet reservoir: 2l

Dimension: approx. 800x850x1500 mm

I know that most homogenizers require spare parts from the same brand/model which may be difficult to find on their own. Reproducing them through custom design could be an option. A better option would be to find generic parts and build one myself. 

I am looking for somebody to give me an idea of which parts to find and advise me on the main components to build such machine. I understand the functioning of the machine, however I could not find a detailed assembly plan online. 

Regarding the websites to find the parts I have already checked McMaster, Misumi and others. I am from Europe and therefore reducing transportation costs would be a big plus. If anybody could advise me on where to look for affordable spare parts that would be awesome.

Has anyone ever left a very small company?,"I currently work as a hardware / firmware engineer at a very small company (4 people).

He said we don't have the money to bring on another full time engineer. I also have to constantly remind him that I am only 1 person.

1. Characteristic curves of machines. Flywheel and its effects. Fundamental equation of rotating systems
2. Balance
3. Vibrations
4. Vibrations analysis


We are currently on the first topic and we are learning to get the start time of a engine (which is, as it's described, the moment where the engine gets to its nominal angular velocity [ω0]) by plotting the characteristic curve of the engine against the curve of the load or vice-versa. To plot one of them in the other one we need to correlate each other through the gear ratio ( n = ωs / ωe ) and the efficiency ( η = Ps / Pe ). You can see one such diagram here: https://imgur.com/a/jEDjuFP. Here, the engine curve is Mm and the Mc is the load curve but related to the engine through the gear ratio and the efficiency. Where these two curves cut each other is where the nominal angular velocity is.

Bit of context Last year I rented my house out to a tenant and gave permission to sub-let which he unknowingly did to an individual who used it as a marijuana farm. He agreed to sort out the damage, did some then didn’t do the rest.

Not sure if you guys have seen a weed house, but there are large ventilation pipes that they put through the ceiling. This left large holes in the floors and ceilings. 


To repair the ceiling, a metal sheet was placed to completely patch the hole, then wood was put over the whole ceiling to enable the plaster to go on, because without it the house was too damp for the plaster to stick.

How do you stop the inside of a hollow iron joist from rusting?,"I'm having a storage floor (raft) installed beneath the roof of my garage, consisting of plywood sheets resting on mild-steel hollow square joists.

I can't possibly paint the inside, the beams are 3 meters long and section is about 10cm x 5cm so barely big enough to insert a hand.

The end flanges don't completely seal off the hollow section at the extremities, so air can still enter. So, should I be concerned about rusting? Wall thickness is about 5mm - how many years would it take for rust to appreciably weaken it? I'd estimate storing about 300kg of stuff on this structure. There are 4 joists in total.

Is there anything I can do to protect the interior? Should I try sealing the ends to the concrete walls with silicone (once installed) and put extra paint or silicone on the joint between the inner and outer beams to prevent air entering as much as possible? Or does that trap moisture and make the problem worse? I enquired about galvanising but that's not an option post-covid",AskEngineers,1645382134
Should I quit my post-graduation Entry Level Civil Engineer role after 3 months?,"I graduated in December 2021 and I was offered a position as an Engineer for the company I was interning with for the past year while I was finishing up school. 

After 3 months I find myself not truly enjoying my time. I consistently keep track of the days for the weekend and when Sunday hits I dread the feeling of waking up for work the next morning. On top of that, the work schedule doesn’t fit into my lifestyle as I’m at work from 7am till 6:30-7pm daily and I feel drained out by the time I get home.

I am thinking something like putting them in the vacuum chamber with the lid unfastened so the air can get out, evacuating the chamber, then repressurizing quickly so the lid gets sucked against the container. After that just fasten the lid for safety. Basically how you would vacuum a mason jar. I know this would be easy to check myself, but I don't have access to a vacuum chamber atm.   


For context: we sell semi-prepared meal kits online, which uses a ton of plastic packaging. I am looking into circular packaging options like reusable containers, but the reverse logistics is looking like quite a pain.

Community &amp; Social work - searching for jobs around the world,"Hi folks, 

I will soon finish my Bachelors in environmental ingeneering with specialisation in hydraulic/coastal engeneering and geotechnics.   
Now I would really like to apply what I have learned in a organisation/company in the community/civil sector. Connecting districts to water supply/waste water disposal, waste disposal in general, agriculture projects (soil and water) or improving living standards in other way crossed my mind. 

I found the ""development service"" in Germany provided by the GIZ or other organisations. The problem there is, that they need professionals with experience and no rookies \^\^'... I am not that arogant to say about myself that I could complete this leading position rather be part of the team.   
The country does not matter, more the project itself. I made accounts on serveral websites (for jobs, internships, and so on...) but I believe locals know much more :) 

**My question to our holy reddit community is now:**   
Do you know an organisation/company/movment in your country which is working in the social engeenering sector with striving to improve in a technical/constructive way the living standards in neglected areas?   


**To summarize some more details:** 

Education:   
\- B.Sc. environmental engeneering (specialisation in water and soil)   
\- languages: german, english, spanish (A2), portugese (A2)   
\- one year volunteer service in India, in a school   
\- ArcGIS, Revit experience

\- company or similar in social, civil ingeenering sector  
\- full time/half time   
\- **payed internship**   
\- environmental protection programs  
\- work with technical share  
\- project limted work

How do microwave ovens power scale and is there a way to use/mod a microwave with bad power settings to better control it?,"I recently replaced my microwave with a rather cheap model (as budget allowed) and unfortunately it's power control is not very good.

As far as I can tell if I use the power level setting on it, it's using bang bang control with a timer. EG: On half power it does full blast for like 10s and off for 10s. 

Given the way my old microwave behaved, I believe it did this too but was also able to adjust the output to some degree. Bang bang with some power scaling so it's not just full blast.

The results are rather disappointing because I would often microwave meat on low power to defrost or warm it without overcooking the edges. Now even at half power I can hear it sizzling during the periods when it's blasting.

I guess I have two questions:

1) Is my understanding correct or are there other factors in power distribution?

Asking for a promotion after telling my boss I want to switch departments,"I've been working at a large Aerospace/Defense company for 2 years after graduating college. I work as a Safety Engieneer, which has been identified as a critical skillset at our company. Currently we are set to have only 2 senior engineers with this skillset at our location once older staff retire soon. We are DESPERATE for more people and we have been struggling with this for years. A couple of months back, there was an opening in a new department and I jumped at the opportunity because I wanted to expand my skills. Luckily, I was in a rotational program for recent college grads so my department couldn't really interfere with me leaving. I technically could have left a year earlier. 

The transition to the new department is set to happen around May of this year. At that point I will have 2.5 years of experience (3 if you count my internship at the same company). In order to get promoted to the next level, you usually need 2.5 - 3 years of experience. I feel my best chance of getting promoted is within my current department. They know my work. They like me. If I were to start over new at a different department, I would face a big learning curve and it would likely take longer to prove myself and earn that promotion. I want to ask for a promotion and get it by May but I feel like I have shot myself in the foot by signaling that I want out of this department soon. 

Is there any way I can convince my department to promote me before handing me off to the new group? I have a meeting with my manager next week to discuss goals for the year and I want to come prepared with a case for my promotion.

The things I have going for me are:
-Proven good performer in a critical skills area that my department is desperate for
-Enough years of experience to be promoted to the next level
-I neglected my rotational program and stayed with my group a year longer than I was supposed to in order to help them out with all of the work they needed help with
-I have the most experience in a wide variety of programs and their lifecycles out of all of the junior engineers in our group
-I could interpret their decision to NOT promote me in that timeframe as an indication that their department doesn't look out for their own and therefore there is no reason for me to rejoin

Is there any way I could leverage any of this in a professional manner for a promotion before they allow me to leave for a new group?",AskEngineers,1645245512

"I still love space, but after 5 years in Aerospace contracting, I don't know where to go","Hello,

I am 5 years into my job (thermal analyst) at one of the prime aerospace/DoD contractors. Most of the time, the work has been slow and I feel a lot of what I have to offer (presentation skills, communicating engineering concepts, systems-thinking) isn't being exercised. 

&amp;#x200B;

That said, the past 2 years have been really good-- I worked a program where those exact things were being exercised. It was a recently conceived program, so the work was highly developmental, innovative, and ""out there"". I was thermal lead for the program, and worked closely with all the other disciplines (e.g. materials, structures, aerodynamics, etc.). We all worked together in a small room, hashing out ideas and drawing on the whiteboard. It was like working in a startup, with the security of working for a big corporation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, that program is gone. The customer is no longer funding it. So 2 years of work... poof. 

I am basically back to being a level 1 (I am a level 3), sitting at their desk doing nothing as I await a new assignment. I am just disillusioned that my company just goes with the flow of government money, and doesn't actually have a vision or invest in IRAD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the work here, besides refurbishing 50 year old tech, just doesn't seem real. Most of the programs don't get off the ground; no one wants to fund them (and understandably so, given how horribly inefficient my company is). Nothing here seems to fly or go anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love space. I want to keep working it. But I am really sad about the possibility of 40 years going by and nothing I worked actually flying in space. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice? Would a smaller company be better? For someone who likes being in front of the customer and likes exercising systems thinking, what would you recommend? Analysis is obviously important, but I don't want to be in a cube running analyses my whole career.

Mechanical vs Mechatronics: current KSU student,"Hey y'all, so I'm currently an undergraduate engineer at Kennesaw State University as a mechanical engineering major. However, I recently found out about my school's mechatronics major program, as well as it's uniqueness (one of 3 in the entire country).

However, I don't know if I would want to change my degree over to mechatronics. I am a little worried about being seen as a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" by many potential employers.  I can't help but wonder if having a mechatronics degree would give me a potential leg up in a world where there are tons and tons of mechanical engineers, and people are saying it may be an oversaturated field.

How are things that are way too big to fit on a truck transported to their destination from the factory/foundry?,"Of course, assuming both the factory and the destination aren't adjacent to the sea, that would make it a lot easier. One example would be very big gantry cranes, which have single parts that look too big for any road transport, at least on public roads. Or some huge machinery in factories also seem to have parts(like huge blocks or structures) that seem to big for the roads, and they seem like genuine single parts, not a welded together part. Do they actually establish a foundry/machining workshop in the factory and forge and machine those huge parts while the factory is first being set-up? Maybe that's feasible for some applications, but others(like huge gantry cranes outdoors) not really. The examples can be multiplied, like propellers and shafts of big ships, very big metal pipes etc. And assuming the forgery/foundry/mill/factory doesn't have a port of it's own for sea transport, nor a railroad for rail transport.",AskEngineers,1645209231

Take a senior role whilst young or develop in current role?,"i'm stuck in a bit of a (good) dilemma. I graduated from my Masters in 2019 and worked in a graduate role (£26,500/$36,000) from 2019-2021. I received excellent feedback, developed really well and fell in love with the industry.

The company I worked at, at that time had a recruitment freeze - so I moved to another company for a significant promotion (from graduate to mid-level) I've been in this role for 6 months (£37,500/$50,000). I find the work manageable, but a little boring and very political. I could easily stay here for a few years though without any issues. My chartership process has been transitioned to this company and they're happy to continue funding/supporting.

Now my old company is hiring again, and after applying, just to see more than anything, I have received an offer for a senior engineer role (£51,150/$70,000). This comes with a £15,000 ($20,000) salary bump as well as responsibility increase. Obviously I'm happy - but my concerns are:

As I'm not currently chartered, will working under more pressure/more intensely affect my ability to become chartered?

I need career advice,"Hello everyone. 

One year ago, you help me choose if I should've followed a PhD in composite materials part-time. (Working full time as a R&amp;D design engineer)

I've now started it, and I'm enjoying it tons. I am now in need of a career advice. So here are some bullet points:

* I am a young graduate (1.5 years of industry and 1 internship)
* My first position was 1 year at a UAV startup, I designed some drones, in which we had components in composite materials.  
* Started my PhD in composite materials in September

&amp;#x200B;

* I left the startup , in September, (I was invited) for a consultant job as a Design Mechanical Engineer in a big consultant/contractor. I've had some performance trouble and difficulties adapting (I got no training nor guidance. I was just thrown into the problems of our clients). I believe the people who hired me had better expectations. However,  I am now getting used to my position and I believe performing way better. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I left the startup because I was the most experienced engineer (we were 3 graduates), building a  20K-60K drone. Even though I loved composites,  I always had to work 10-12 hours, every day, studying to understand even the most basic stuff because I had no one to help me. 
* The work environment was great, but I was always receiving critiques on my work from non-technical people because “it was not pretty” or that “we could sacrifice performance for the sake of aesthetics”. 
* Nobody cared about my opinions about my own job, and I was always on the defensive mode. Even though I loved composites, there was no growing and learning here. I really stopped believing in the dream, as I never cared about drones.
*  Additionally, they asked me to do stuff that went against my professional ethics, which I refused. 
* Oh, and the pay was shitty because it was a startup (not a problem because I really enjoyed the project, because of the composite materials).  Don't forget I was a fresh graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

Been 6 months on my new job, but I've been trying to go back to composite materials design again. In my country, there aren't many opportunities. 

I've had 3 interviews, in the composite design field, and the most complex questions that I've to answer are:

* Why did you left your old company if you loved composite materials?
* Why didn't you apply for composite materials and are now working an R&amp;D engineer in machine design?

The skills that I use in my new job are similar to my old job: FEA, 2D drawing, 3D modelling, etc etc. My consultancy company told me that in the future they will put me in Composite Design positions, but I don't believe so. 

Is too late to go back to composite design materials? If not, what do I have to do to enter this position again? I'm already doing my PhD to learn the most as I can about the subject. 

Also, I am afraid that changing jobs only after 6 months is bad for my resume. I also think about what it might tell about me as a person: can't I be satisfied? What if I change jobs again, and I can't stay? 

Or is this just bullshit that companies tell you so that you don't ask for better benefits? Should I really try to invest in my consultant job and try a few years later again in composite design positions?

Sorry if it's confusing, but I am confused as well. I just hope I haven't destroyed my opportunities to work in composite design again, but I also don't want to burn my CV. 

However, I am very grateful for having a good job in R&amp;D (which is what I love) and having the opportunity of doing my PhD as well. I am aware that I am very lucky to be in this position.

Frustrated with myself and with my employer,"I’m not sure if it is like this everywhere, if its just me, just my employer, or just how things really are.  I have been with my employer for several years (since I was a college intern).  I’ve always felt like I have a hard time being respected and taken seriously.  It’s like people don’t know how to communicate with me if they can’t pick on me and make fun of me.  I also get interrupted a lot, especially when small talk is being made.  My coworkers will pick on me about being “the quiet one” but then when I talk they interrupt me.  

There also seems to be a common vibe that people here more about being liked than they do about being respected, and that everyone is “too cool to care” about their role as a professional.  

I’d like to give more details but would rather keep this vague for the purpose of remaining anonymous.  Does this ring a bell with any weaknesses I may have as a person/professional, or any typical workplace woes that everyone has to deal with.",AskEngineers,1645192468

Private consultancy -&gt; state transport authority - 6yr geotech engineer (AUS),"I've been working as a geotech for 6yrs mainly in infrastructure and a little land development. I've got a good breadth of experience under my belt (investigation, design, reporting, PM, construction services) and have had the chance to work on nationally significant infrastructure. Currently working with a large multinational and have worked in similar companies for the last 5yrs.

Just had an interview with the state transport authority, and it went well. The role is internal technical advisory so I would be doing the same kind of work as I would be doing in a private consultancy, but I'd be working 'client'-side. I'm excited about the role mainly because of the job stability and benefits (flexible work hours, hybrid WFH, 35hr work week + paid overtime). It would also pay well.

The ad appeared online with good timing as the major project I'm working on is winding down, but between applying and getting the interview, I've been tagged to move onto a very interesting tender design that's got my nerd juices flowing. The infrastructure pipeline in our state is massive so the industry outlook is very positive for the next 10-15yrs. Every engineering company in infrastructure is working at or near capacity.

I have doubts as to whether I can be as engaged with and interested in the work. On paper I'd be working on the same projects that I am currently delivering to the state so you wouldn't think engagement would be a problem.

Now: is it really necessary to build them that way, especially when they have circulating air? It just seems like a huge waste of energy and a nuisance (preheating, lots of extra heat in your flat during warm weather). Is the heating element in front of the ventilator just way too weak to heat all the air in a short period of time, assuming you'd remove all of the heat reservoirs, leaving only the structurally necessary, high heat capacity elements you couldn't get rid of? Could you compensate with a beefier heating element, or are we already at the limit of electrical supply there?

graduating without amazing internships,"hey guys, i'm set to graduate from mechanical engineering next spring and will be completing my fifth and final internship of my undergraduate career, however I'm really worried about job prospects and general happiness post graduation. All the internships I've worked at haven't been crazy design experience or at prestigious companies, and they dont really connect to each other. I am hoping to get into automation/controls and/or design positions but have only gained 'exposure' to these fields rather than made actual contributions. I've already accepted an offer for my summer internship, but its really not an amazing position (its mainly CAD editing and general intern bs, not like I'm designing the systems itself). To be completely honest, I accepted because its location would allow me to stay home and cut costs so that I can save to travel/enjoy my summer. I'm afraid this choice will negatively affect my job prospects post graduation because typically students at my level are aiming super high. I've always felt inferior due to this but after some shitty past interviews with these huge companies, I was really nervous about aiming high for this summer.  I also generally want to treat engineering/my career as a means to fund my other passions in life, but I feel like this lowers my value as an engineer when looking for jobs, and I'm not sure whether this is the right attitude to have at this stage in life.

How to think about mass and dynamics in a scale model,"Trying to wrap my head around this, it's proving a fun challenge.

Suppose I have a scale model of a structure I want to build, at 1:10 scale.

The reason I have this model is to understand how the real structure would behave with regard to how and where it bends, distorts, how it behaves in general.

Suppose the structure has a volume of a known mass at full scale. When I scale down the proportions, is the correct way to interpret how the mass changes,  to simply scale the linear dimensions, recalculate the volume, and derive a new mass via the new volume combined with the original density?

This seems weird but a thought creeps in, that if the goal is to consider how a material will behave at by creating a shrunken version of it, that you would in some respects want to densify the matter as you shrink the scale. 

But the I get back to the concept of intrinsic and extrinsic properties.

If density is intrinsic, then when I scale dimensions, I go through the cube/square situation, but at the end, I can treat density as something that functions the same at any scale.
More to the point, properties like stiffness, or should we say modulus of elasticity, stay the same at all scales save down to a couple atoms.

I think, to distill the essence of this question, if you make a scale model to investigate the dynamic properties of a structure, can you make your model out of the same material as the full scale and thereby accurately model the dynamics, or does the mass need to undergo a transition of it's own to model those dynamics in miniature.",AskEngineers,1645163395
What are some good questions to ask a Mech Eng/old colleague about the company they work for that you are considering employment at?,"**TLDR AT THE BOTTOM**  
\---  
**So some background...**

* Have been contemplating a new role/company for a bit now
* I work for a large fortune 500 company in the the Automotive sector currently.
* I've been a design engineer here for 4 years (previously associate design engineer for 2 years at the same place)
* I got one raise/merit increase one year after being in my DE role before merit increases were cut from budget due to covid, so I have been stuck at this salary (we were given some vesting stock options as an HR gimmick for employee retention during covid)
* My projects have grown to the scope and complexity of senior level work without pay adjustments
* I have been pushing my boss, my boss's old boss, and now my boss's new boss to look into salary negotiation without success

Recently a recruiter/director of HR for a small (maybe mid sized) company reached out to me via text about a Sr. DE opening that pays 95-115k a year. They're a supplier of automotive parts for various auto companies...

As it turns out my boss's old boss (a chief engineer) who recently left the company, now works for this new company as VP of Engineering as of 3 months now, and noticed my name on a list of potential candidates and recommended he (HR) reach out to me. *(He mentioned my colleagues name in one of the texts so I did some research to make sure it was the same guy who left my current job... and sure enough, it was).*

So I reached out to him (we weren't incredibly close, but I've spoken with him in person a few times) on LinkedIn to verify the recruiters story was earnest... I asked him if he'd be willing to meet up **so I can talk with someone more candidly** about the company, rather than pre-canned answers from HR in an interview. We meet this Wednesday

*I've been considering moving over to purchasing too (since I also have a supply chain/business degree) for a small pay bump and also to get out of the mental fatigue and complexity that engineering places on me at times, as I'm not sure I want to continue down the technical path to senior........ But I make 75k now and 95-115k is hard to ignore. Also, my current project is very complex, and I know very well my boss and my boss's boss do NOT want to use me, so could also potentially use a job offer as leverage for salary negotiation.*

**tl;dr - What would be some good questions to ask an old colleague about their new job/company I'm contemplating a Sr. DE role at about:**

* **The company**
* **The product**
* **The culture**
* **Expectations**
* **Scope of work (wearing one hat, or many hats)**
* **Tools and product development methodologies**
* **Benefits**

1- i read you can’t just cut the beam where I need a door as it weakens the entire thing. I assume this is true in this situation 

2- could the beam be raised? I.e dig it out of foundation and raise it up? Or would it be easier to remove

If I were to dimension say a flange with a bolting pattern and leave any datums and feature controls off of the drawing, would I be in violation of Y14.5.

Oversize a screw clearance hole or template from a mating piece, or spend a few extra seconds dialing in the machine tools.

Can you guys give cost estimates/rule of thumb/heuristics for understanding when is each more betterer? 

I currently hold the view that LRT makes no sense because laying the rail is expensive _and_ inflexible in short-term (you cannot reroute LRT) nor long-term (you cannot change routes to accommodate city changes).

I have an idea for a product online with one of my hobbies that I feel is very lacking in the market. I know the demographic and I cannot find anything similar on offer online.

It is essentially the ability to create a custom case for a piece of equipment (I would like to keep it a secret but let’s say for example a case for a guitar)  that sort of length, but thinner. There is nowhere online that offers the ability to specially design and customise a case and have it created for a specific person so it is unique. I feel from my understanding of the community that this would be very popular. 

My question is how would I manufacture this?

Would it be easier to find a supplier in China that do basic cases, ask if they’ll do custom and then work with a designer on fiverr to mock-up a design for the manufacturer? 

Or order blank cases and somehow print the designs on myself? (Again, I don’t know what software / technique would be best for this)

Or should I try and create them myself? Would this be 3D printing? Or perhaps injection molding? 

Ideally the cases would be made from plastisol or leather, would obviously need to be hollow on the inside and need to be durable to withstand, wear, the elements etc

Would you suggest I learn illustrator to mock them up myself?

Regarding Truss - Moment Equilibrium Direction,"I'm fairly new to this whole truss problems but have been able to understand the essence of virtual work in place, however what I can't understand the moment if a structure has a vertical component and some force (point load) acted perpendicular to it (disregard sign convention), why do we map that vertical component's moment with its height (y axis) rather its length (x axis) **(1) and vice versa**, even so shouldn't we solve for a ""lever arm"" so essentially square root ( a\^2 + b\^2) \* cos theta **(2)** \- in order to find the normal force and have that be the moment or am I misunderstanding something here?

Getting a mining job in australia 4 years after graduating? -seeking advice how to get a foot in it,"Hi all, long time reader, first time poster

So i graduated with a chem eng degree in 2019 from curtin, and to be fair my work history is a bit patchy.
For around 17 months i worked as a junior project engineer on the prelude flng project (got laid off due to covid as i was unable to travel due to border restrictions). 

I applied for a grad position at my current company, but got rejected due to having too much experience, hence they told me to go into a proper project engineer role, but none of them would take me on, so got offered an engineering coordinator position, which i took as a means of ""getting my foot in the door"" to eventually get a project engineering job. Unfortunately there is shit all growth in my role and i believe my career progression has stagnated.

Looking for an explanation and a solution to a weird pressure (?) issue between two rooms that causes cold air to enter one and turn it into the arctic.,"I own a restaurant in a rather warm city but our dining room feels like Antarctica sometimes and I think it is mostly due to the pressure/wind from one room to the next. Part of me wants to understand it just to know but I also need to fix it. There are two rooms in this equation. The ""Interior Dining Space"" and the ""Patio Room"". And two main doors ""Main Entry Door"" and ""Patio door"".

The Interior Dining Space is the first room you would walk into upon entry of the business. There is the main entry door (pretty well shielded from wind entering) at the front of this room. Upon entering through the main entry door immediately to the right is a door that leads to what we call the Patio Room. There is another door in the interior dining room space further inside and along the same right wall as the  the door that led to the Patio Room and a swinging door in the back of the Interior Dining Space which leads to the kitchen although I think these doors are mostly non related to the issue so I won't mention them further. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Patio Room  is a square room, fair to say it is to the right of the Interior Dining Space. The Patio Room has a ceiling and walls on its East and West sides, however, on the North and South sides it is almost entirely open to the outside world. The south side we have installed a retractable barrier which we leave down on cold nights which acts as a sort of wall. There are strong ceiling heaters in Room B, those, coupled with the barrier, leave the room nice and toasty, I could mention now that the heat in Room A doesn't work all that well. The patio door is on the west side of the Patio Room (and leads to Room A). This Patio door is poorly shielded from wind, having about 1/2inch gaps on all sides of it. This is a swinging door which swings both ways (into room A or Room B). 

Both room are relatively small - thin 40 feet by 40 feet square rooms each.

So.... The patio door between the Interior Dining Space and the Patio Room is always partially open into  the Interior Dining Space direction. This seems to happen no matter what - people inside or not, heaters on or not, business hours or fully closed, hot or cold nights (pretty sure), etc. The door opens in the direction of Room A because of a SUBSTANTIAL amount of wind rushing through and into the Patio Door. I put my hand in the gap the wind creates and am always amazed by how much wind seems to be rushing through on what is an insanely calm day. When pressing the Patio Door open (going from Room A to Room B) it takes a surprising amount of force to overcome the wind. Its not like difficult to open or anything, just a surprising amount of force compared to what you'd expect. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... that causes Room A to feel very cold especially in certain seats where I suppose the wind just flows towards more than others. What is weird is even if the Patio Room is very nice and warm, the wind rushing through it will cause the Interior Dining Space to feel equally cold all nights, it doesn't seem to care how warm the Patio Room is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was looking at the door with a server and talking about how to fix it and I felt nobody was as shocked as I was with how intense the pressure/wind issue was. The server explained it makes perfect sense as the wind rushes in from the North opening in the Patio Room, can't escape through the South opening due to the barrier, then the wind is forced to the Patio Door and presses it open. As soon as she mentioned this.... someone came in and opened the Front Door in the Interior Dining Space and once they did, the Patio Door stopped being forced open by the wind/pressure and acted like a normal door. 

Maybe I sound like an absolute moron spoiled by living in the most pleasing weather in the country, and maybe this is a common thing in more places than I know, but I still find it interesting. I feel pretty confident that it is a pressure issue between the two rooms, but I would love to understand why. I don't believe it is related to temperature, is it simply due to the odd structure of the Patio Room? 

I have some very obvious lists of things to do to rectify this issue. Improving the heating in the Interior Space. Sealing off the edges and perhaps making a stop for the Patio Door. I think I am just curious if anyone more familiar with the outcomes of simply sealing off the Patio Door. Would that lead to any dead zones/cold spots in the Patio Room? Is the solution that simple or is there more I need to take into consideration here? 

My apologies if this is a painfully obvious questions, I seem to be more entertained by the situation than most.",AskEngineers,1645074062

Does a change in modulus change the resulting stress?,"Hello,  I am a working engineer and I am finishing my master's degree about now-ish. I have been working on a thesis that revolves around the material properties of composites. I had a bit of an argument with my advisor today that went like this:

Me:  ""I can show an increase in the transverse modulus. The laminate doesn't show much of a change in stress under the same loading condition.""

Advisor:  ""That doesn't make sense, you made a mistake in your CLT programming, go find it.""

Me:  ""I have looked and cant find any mistakes. I think it makes sense because the modulus doesn't really contribute to stress as much as \[a  list of other factors\].""

Advisor: ""Think of Hooke's Law, of course it does! Think of a tensile test!""

Me:  ""In a tensile test we measure strain and we know the input force and geometry of the sample... so if the modulus is increased then we should expect the strain to decrease. The affected quantity should be the stiffness/deflection if the modulus increases, not the stress.""

Advisor: ""Your absolutely wrong (approaching yelling).""

Determine power of electric scooter,"My question is regarding how a electric motor controller is related to the power of the actual motor.

So I just bought an electric scooter the other day. It is a Norwegian rebrand of some Chinese scooter sometimes named Maxwheel or iScooter. Anyways, I wanted a scooter with a relatively high power since I weigh around 200 lbs and want to be able to climb hills. The one I bought was advertised with a nominal power of 500 W, with a peak of 1000W. An important factor to note is that the scooter has a maximum speed of around 13 mph in order to be legal in Norway, while the scooter is actually made to go around 19 mph. How they turn down the maximum speed I am not sure of, but I am guessing the motor controller or firmware is involved.

I received the scooter yesterday, and figured I wanted to verify the actual power of the scooter/controller. [And why was I not surprised to see a motor controller with a rated power of 350 W](https://imgur.com/a/BvB3gW9), and not the advertised 500 W. If I look at the motor it has some [numbers on it which states 36V30A](https://imgur.com/a/uD3gZsv) (equaling 1000W), but the same numbers are seen on 350W Xiaomi 365 motors on aliexpress, so I am not sure exactly what they mean.

I should add that it is possible to buy this scooter as the advertised 500W with both the nominal speed (19 mph) and the throttled speed (13 mph). They also sell a advertised 350W scooter with the both same maximum speeds as for the 500W version.

So, do you guys know if I have been hustled, or could this be as expected considering the throttled max speed of the scooter?

Working for a company that thrives on Change Orders,"This is sort of a question, sort of a rant. Couldn't think of a better way to title the post.

Question: How many of you have worked for design companies that do the absolute bare minimum to meet a specification for the sole purpose of creating change orders when anything is questioned by the client that isn't black and white in the spec?

I work for a company that does custom jobs for client based on client specs or agreed upon proposals.  The owner LOVES doing change orders because it means more money and more time.  So we are often building things to the black and white of a spec and where it is gray we make our own judgement, to the most benefit of the company with complete disregard for the known parameters of the job.  This quite often leads to change orders where, because something wasn't black and white, the client is charged more than the original order to redo what we did, but this time with the client in mind.  The worst example to day was when I was told directly that the client was in the process of updating their specification.  So we were to make our design just barely meet that spec requirement because when the spec change is finished, the design will not meet the new requirement.  This will then lead to ANOTHER change order on this job and delay the project further.

This kind of business operation just seems sleezy to me.

How do you prefer to be approached by a salesperson?,"I wanted to get some first-hand feedback from you folks here to see how I can do my job in the most frictionless way possible when prospecting to, you know it, engineers.

A lot of us sales guys and gals get trained up and down on how to cold prospect clientele of all kinds, but every persona is different.

Inevitably, many of you will be approached by a salesperson like myself slinging some snazzy tech product. Personally, I only work for companies that I truly believe have something amazing to offer. However, I understand that from your perspective it can seem like I'm only trying to hit a quota by any means possible, and I get that. No one wants to feel like a means to an end. I have no problem conveying value once the conversation is started, but my prospecting can always improve.

"""Do not disturb"" etiquette and ideas","I work 3-4 days a week in an open office with my coworkers (WFH the other day(s)). It's a small company, so I wear a lot of hats. There are some times when I really need to focus on a specific task or solving a specific problem, but don't want to pack up my laptop, monitor, and all my stuff to move to a conference room, since it helps to have the extra viewing space. I can set my chat status to ""do not disturb"", but that doesn't stop in-person interruptions. Obviously, I can tell the person ""I'm busy, and will help you later"", but even that small interruption throws off my train of thought and flow. I've taken to taping a sign to my back when I'm in a headspace like this that says ""please do not disturb unless something is on fire.""

How to determine specs for vacuum system,"My team is building a robot that needs to use vacuum to move a load, but none of us are experts in pneumatics and we have a disagreement about the specific of the vacuum system to use. 

The vacuum cups will be parallel to the ground and move the load in that direction via linear actuators. Speed isnt a concern so this can be as slow as 10mm/s. The load itself is unknown, but we are estimating for safety that the load will be less than 5kgs.

What we need to figure out is:
1. Size of cups and number of cups
2. Vacuum pressure required at each cup, which leads to how many ejectors needed (1 per cup, 1 per 2 cups, etc)
3. Compressor needed to supply based on loss from ejectors

Additionally, we couldnt agree on how the vacuum is split if we run 2+ cups on one ejector vs one cup on one ejector. What are the physics at play here? We reached a paradox where if you increased the area indefinitely, while maintaining the flow rate, speed would decrease which would increase pressure, but we cant land on why it wouldnt increase indefinitely as well.

Lastly, where can you find breakaway force of cups? No supplier we have found actually lists it.

Advice for choosing between two strong job offers,"Hey y’all, I recently received a second job offer from one of the big tech companies as an entry level Process Engineer. I already had an offer from a smaller commissioning company as a Junior Chemical Engineer. I’m having trouble deciding between the two. For the ChemE job they offered me $86k a year and they recruited me from job boards. The work seems interesting but I’d be traveling often as they are contractors. For the Process engineer position, I had to apply and go through about 4 interviews before getting the offer, $71k a year base and $8k in stock options. I’m negotiating rn for $76k base, $8k in stock options, and $6k signing bonus. The problem is I don’t know which job would be better for my long term career goals. 
In the long run I would like to work for Neuralink, Meta, or whatever company working with brain body interfaces and VR. I don’t have much engineering experience and I graduated in 2020 as a BS ChemE with research and internship experience. I really don’t know who to ask for advice since I’m a first generation college grad and I’m a bit over my head with these offers. Most people that I’ve talked to suggest I take the process Engineering role as it’s with a well known company and has stock options along with excellent benefits. 
However I believe that actual chemical engineering roles are hard to come by and will be more versatile in the future.

"Engineers who work/worked at design consultancies, do you like it?","I am expecting an offer soon from a design consultancy for a mechanical design engineer position. My current position is very analytical and most of my workload is dealing with vendors or wrangling documentation. I really really miss doing design work, which is what I did at my last job and what I thought I would do at this job. Supposedly we are going to start designing a whole new product later this year, but I get the sense my department will not be doing a lot of the actual design and will instead be responsible for managing the designs of outsource partners, since nobody on my team except me has really done any kind of low-level design work before.

This new position is at the type of place that my current company would outsource design work to. Same industry even. Their engineers spend the majority of their time designing machines and products and not as much time juggling vendors or dealing with supply chain stuff because, well, they ARE the vendor. The work looks far more interesting to me and would allow me to develop the skill sets I want to develop. Only thing is I have never worked for a consultancy before. The whole tracking billable hours thing sounds tedious. Part of me worries that if I ever want to go back to a large company like my current gig, I won't have enough product lifecycle experience to get back in at the level I will be at, even if my technical design knowledge will be good. I don't really know how consultancies are viewed by other companies. I can't tell if consultancies are respected, or viewed as someone to offload bullshit onto. Maybe it depends on the context and companies in question?

I don't know salary and benefits details yet, but those will obviously weigh heavily in my decision, as will the amount of WFH they let me do. For reference, I have about 5 years experience with a BSME, and 2 years of part-time internship experience at a factory from when I was in school.

Data Scientist Opportunities within Biomedical Engineering Field,"**Background -** Undergrad degree in Mech. Engineering. Realized I didn't want to do that for a career and swiftly transitioned to a career in Data Science.

I've been a DS for 6 years since I graduated from college and I'm currently a Senior ML Engineer at a startup. My end goal has always been to leverage my DS skills/experience to trace back to an engineering-focused company.

I am highly interested in biomed companies that are working with artificial organs, medical imaging, exoskeletons, or prosthetics. I don't think it's wise to ""soft"" reset myself by becoming an engineer so if there's a way for me to work alongside engineers, that'd be awesome.

\- What sorts of skills are in need from a DS/software engineering standpoint?

\- Is biomedical domain knowledge necessary? I feel like this could be acquired on the job",AskEngineers,1644983489

Does an NDA continue to exist if the company I agreed to NDA with went through partial acquisition and now my employer is officially a different company?,"\-I signed an NDA for Company B while working as a contract employee for Company C.  
\-Company B gave me a direct-hire offer that I accepted.   
\-Company A acquired a portion of Company B almost immediately after the period where I accepted direct offer from Company B.   
\-Company A only acquired SOME of Company B's offices, assets, etc. Company B **still exists**.  
\-I was transferred along with the acquisition and am now directly employed by Company A.   


As far as I can recall, no new NDA nor Non-Compete were signed. The NDA and Non-Compete I have with my signature on it all very specifically state that the NDA and Non-Compete exist with Company B. I have no memory nor any record of any new NDA or Non-Compete being presented or signed with Company A's name or information on it. The portion of Company B that was acquired also immediately changed names and is nowhere even relatively close to the company name listed on the signed NDA and Non-Compete.  


Am I contractually bound to uphold these non-compete and NDA agreements, signed in contract with Company B, now that I am an employee of Company A after Company B was only *partially* obtained through the acquisition?   


From my understanding, since Company B was not 100% bought out, and still exists - that agreement still exists with Company B... NOT with Company A. 

And that Company B could still pursue breach of the NDA and/or non-compete if they chose, since they are still a legal business operating under the same name as the one listed on the signed NDA &amp; Non-Compete. I Think the likelihood of that happening is almost 0, so that's not my concern.  


My concern is if my current company can hold me accountable to an NDA and Non-Compete I signed with an entirely different company. Again, I was in one of the offices that were bought out through a partial acquisition and thus the company I originally agreed to NDA and Non-Compete with are still legally open for business and operating in the same industry.",AskEngineers,1644976763

However, when I looked up application engineering positions at this company, Glassdoor said the average reported salary was 85K, which is above my offer. I assume to take this with a little grain of salt, as it doesn't specify how much experience these people had, and was based off 10 salaries.

[Manufacturing] Why do they lie to us about overwork and safety?,"So this is something I’ve been mulling over in my mind for awhile and I wanted to put it out there to make sure I’m not crazy and get other peoples’ thoughts.

I work for a manufacturing company, and (like most of them), they push safety as their “#1 priority”. 

However, this company works their hourly employees 12 hours per day, their salary employees something like 10-12.

Every single study I can find on the topic says overtime work like this leads to a large increase in safety incidents. Some as low as 29%, some as high as 61%. 

So, the company that supposedly holds safety as their #1 priority is literally working their employees so hard its causing them physical injury. So, they are straight up lying. Safety is not their #1 priority, or they would reduce our working hours.

What kind of engineering job rewards a deep dive mentality?,"I don't think that the industry I'm in is for me and I need help figuring out what roads I might take. 

Let me preface this by saying that I recognize I have flaws, I'm a young engineer, and I'm going to need to adjust my approach. But I'm a hard worker, I am smart, I am driven, and I am great at written communication (technical or otherwise). I also understand the difference between theory and practicality. I understand the need for efficiency, and intend to be very efficient once I've had a chance to learn a subject (I become kind of encyclopedic). I've been a mechanic and a service manager. I've done school but I've also done some extracurricular design projects during my time there that were pretty awesome. I worked in quality Engineering too. I've worked in some capacity for almost 15 years. So this isn't a situation of not understanding the different mindset between school and work. I'm sure part of it is indeed ""new engineer syndrome"" but it also feels, at least in part, more fundamental.

I work in contract manufacturing where OEMs are our customers. And it seems like my way of working does not bring value. I am maybe too analytical, and too indecisive, and not fast enough. But that's because I like to delve into an issue, to understand it on a detailed level, to optimize, to anticipate what could happen, to get to the root of the matter and develop a design/test plan accordingly, to automate, to improve. I like variety, but I want depth too. Heck, I want to do more math! And in this business it feels like none of that matters. What matters is getting something out that is good enough, as cheaply and as quickly as possible. Copy and paste whatever you can. Use the familiar when you can instead of investigating another possible option. Just move forward with the fastest, simplest, cheapest idea, and if it doesn't work don't spend much time trying to find the why, just try something else.

How honest about why I might be leaving?,"I'm thinking of leaving my current EE job because I'm burned out, and I don't see it getting better. I've been here for 14 years, and I'm paid really well, like more than I dreamed. It was my first job out of school. The problem is that the job is cyclical in terms of stress, with periods of a few months once or twice a year where I'm under incredible pressure and stress to the point of crying while I drive home. I am passionate about the job, like everything I do, and I probably am deficient in how I handle workload and hold boundaries. 

I feel like the high pay is 1) rewarding me for being the guy who puts out fires and 2) an excuse to expect me to be the guy who puts out fires. In other words, I don't necessarily appreciate the high pay because of the pain it entails. I'm pegged in a role and I don't think I'll ever stop having it while I'm at this company. 

I honestly wonder sometimes if a lot of my issues at work are my own fault. I've decided that I probably have ADHD, and I'm working on getting an appointment for a diagnosis, and I also am working on getting an appointment for a therapist. I'm hoping to address some root issues in my own life in case my problems follow me to any other job I go to. 

What has changed is that the company is short staffed, and so my workload is be steadily intense for more than a year, plus some major events in my personal life (parent dying, new baby with major health issues), I'm feeling very dysfunctional at work. My productivity has tanked and I feel really guilty about it. 

I have a friend who runs a company which is in the same industry but a different type of work, and I am almost positive I will move to work for him. The job is interesting, and I can see myself as a good fit there. It's not a dream job, but I'm looking forward to trying it out.

Do prescription glasses/contacts factor into the optics calculations for multi-lens (stereo) microscopes?,"**For context** -  I am a jeweler who is looking at buying an expensive and custom order microscope, with no ability to try it out before hand. My glasses prescription is -6.5 (roughly a natural 10x magnification without glasses) with a slight astigmatism in one eye. I need to use Dremel style rotary tools between the scope head and what I am working on, so I am looking at microscopes with a larger objective (working distance). Ideally, I would want 30-60 cm (1-2 ft), or minimally ~15 cm (6 in). Final magnification would need to be ~20x.

________________



I have always struggled to get things in focus when using microscopes at work, or in science class. The main issue I have is that the working distance when I get things in focus seems to be shorter than for my former coworkers, forcing me to compromise between magnification power and working distance. I have had more success when wearing contacts, but the focus and light diffraction seems subjectively worse... However, I can't shake the feeling that I am imagining the problem and am missing something obvious. 


I have spent a ton of time pouring over my old college optics texts books and Google searches, but haven't found anything that addresses this issue in particular.

Is it better to get design experience before management?,"Hey guys. Been in my engineering career post university for about a year now. 

I’ve been working in the systems team in a big consultancy and tbh, I haven’t enjoyed it. It’s very managementy. I’ve done asset breakdown structures (glorified data entry) for close to 9 months now and all I’ll be moved onto after will be more paperwork/management work. More challenging work, but still management and no actual design. And that doesn’t fill me with joy. 

I have an offer with another team in the consultancy to move and do some design work. I’d like to do it. But I feel quite conflicted about it. 

I feel like I’d be abandoning my team. For the most part they’re lovely people. It’s useful work but I just don’t enjoy it very much. I’ve also been asking to be rotated for months now (I’m on a graduate scheme and the whole reason I took it was so I could see other areas of the company) and the fact I still haven’t been moved makes me feel a bit undervalued. 

I kinda was under the personal impression that getting design and directly technical experience first would be better for when I do inevitably move up to a management position. Give me a better knowledge of the systems I’m actually working on.

"""Floating"" a Granite Sphere on water (Kugel Fountain)","[This is an (OC) MS paint sketch of the system I'm trying to study.](https://imgur.com/wjYeDfg) (imgur link) 

I am trying to understand the physics and math behind this. It's formally known as a [Kugel fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugel_fountain). 

I am trying to learn **how to calculate the net force exerted on a hemisphere, when its curved surface is subject to a uniform pressure.** 

I know I have to integrate over some function that describes the curvature of the sphere. But I don't know how to setup the equations.

Or am I overthinking this ? 

Can I just take the area of a circle and multiply that with the water pressure to get the vertical component of the force exerted on the hemisphere? 

All the horizontal components should cancel out due to the symmetry of the hemisphere

I tried to put some real numbers to the problem. 

In my example case:

Density of granite -   2700kg /m^(3)  
Sphere Diameter - 30 cm   
Approximate weight of this sphere - 39 kg   
Approximate weight exerted \~ 400 N

Pressure of water = 1 bar =  100 kPA  
(The average home has at least 1 bar of pressure from Google)

How high would the water have to be on the sphere to balance its weight?

Company A eventually harmonized the roles, doing away with a bunch of the roles as-defined by Company B and therefore creating consistency in roles across the board.   


Company A now has me in their system as an Entry Level Engineer (i.e. a recent graduate) which has significantly less duties than I have been held to since signing employment offer from Company B. Company A claims they cannot find the employment offer I signed with Company B but they can, however, find the email that was sent to HR acknowledging I had accepted the offer and what the details of that offer were.

Document I signed listed me as one Title w/ one set of job duties.   
Company now has me listed as a lower tier title w/ a substantially reduced set of job duties.

I'll start, I have an idea for a utility scale energy system because it requires a big system to work efficiently, however, as much as I put together thermodynamic models on it, it feels like I'm overlooking something. Since it is so enormous in scale, I have no clue how to get funding for it. I know grants exist for this stuff, and I've applied to them but they want to know commercial viability. Without a grant to do significant development work on it, it's hard to price it. Without knowing pricing and estimated lifecycle costs, it's hard to get letters of interest from utilities and its a cycle. It's not a casual endeavor, so I've been stuck for a few years.

DON’T LOOK AT MY LAST POST LOOOOL. Got my raise and it was way below what I was expecting. Looking to start applying else where.

"Advice for an Environmental Engineer (Carrer Pivots in California, USA)","Hi Everyone

This one is going to be kinda long but to get straight to the questions in case anyone knows.

Question: 

		(1) If I have an accredited Environmental Engineering degree is it possible for me to eventually take the P.E. exam for Civil and Environmental Engineering?

		(2) Can I use my Environmental Engineering Degree to count as the 3-year credit that is mentioned in the California Class A General Engineering Contractors License or the Class B General Building Contractor License, or any of the 40 different categories of Class C licenses? Or would I have to start at the journeyman level?

To start off due to personal things that happened throughout college I graduated about 6 months ago with an Environmental Engineering Degree with a GPA of 2.4 (Civil was not an option at my school). Adding to it is the fact I didn't do any internships; I did work throughout college, but never in engineering-related positions. With that being said I'm aware that this, and not having passed my FE exam has basically made it impossible for me to get through any door. But alas I've continued on applying to positions that don't require an EIT license and picked up basic certifications such as HAZWOPER 40hr and OSHA-10 to improve my odds. I've also started studying for the FE exam as a way for me to try to get on track. 

I know that I should probably just focus on the end goal of getting my PE for Environmental engineering but after thinking about what I really want in life as a whole I came to a couple of conclusions, and I'm wondering how to go about it. 

First is I want to get a PE license in Civil and Environmental engineering, like others, my immediate thought was going back to school for civil but since I want to do more residential development. My question is; is it possible for me to work for 2 years in an entry-level civil engineering position, then just qualify to take the PE Civil and environmental exam because of time and school? Or is school the only option, or ...? 

Second is I'd like to get a contractor's license, preferably either the Class A General Engineering Contractors License or the Class B General Building Contractor License. With the goal of one day owning my own company and doing everything in-house (from designing it to stamping it to building it). I'm aware that school knowledge doesn't transfer to trades knowledge but I have prior experience basically working as an apprentice (Child labor lol). Meaning I know the basics of plumbing, and electrical; plus I'm also able to read and understand M.E.P. drafts. Basically, my second question is can I use my Environmental Engineering Degree to count as the 3-year credit that is mentioned in Calfornia Class A General Engineering Contractor License or Class B General Building Contractor License, or any of the 40 different categories of Class C licenses? Or would I have to start at the journeyman level?

Salary for Technical Manager (UK)?,"Hi all

I've recently (28th October 2021) joined a company that is a leading global supplier of cast-iron automotive components. I joined after submitting my Ph.D. in metallurgy &amp; advanced manufacturing technology. Which I passed (viva) back in December. 

I was initially inducted into their graduate training program. The post I initially applied for was more of a process engineer type of role. My boss at the time said it's wasn't very suitable as It was more of a hands-on job that required a lot of experience. And it wasn't the best use out of my research/scientific training. But he wanted to induct me regardless, as the company seeks trained metallurgists/scientists leading the company in the future, and possibly taking it in a new direction. 

My starting salary is £32,000, which is quite a bit more than what they normally pay for their graduate program (named the Management training program). I'm currently based at our UK sight (HQ), but I'll also spend time at our China (Dalian), Mexico City, Czech Republic, Germany, and Denmark sights. All expenses paid for (including rent, when I'm outside the UK at least). 

The graduate scheme is usually 1-2 years long. But my manager told me (in a super thick Brummy accent) I have already more or less completed the graduate scheme in just 5 months. My main job was to write technical reports critically assessing our processes at the foundry. They were really happy with it apparently. I have also taken initiatives in setting up, for the first time, joint industry-to-academia research collaborations by drafting potential projects that would be conducted by MSc or Ph.D. students under my supervision. 

But now they want me to be a Technical Manager fairly soon (perhaps next month). We have a lot of managers at the firm (R&amp;D, Quality, production, etc), but not a technical one, so it's a new position. My job would be to propose R&amp;D projects to our R&amp;D manager, as well as continually assess our current technologies and methodologies. The role is a bit vague it was just briefly proposed to me. But I essentially completed my management training scheme, and am now appears ready to become a manager 

Any idea about the expected salary range? One thing to note is that the company struggled to keep their grad scheme graduates, as our other divisions (mostly China and Mexico) tend to take them away. So they'll have to pay really well to keep me in the UK! (i was gunning for our China division in Dalian)",AskEngineers,1644873782

But the answers to those questions are almost always ""civil"" because that is what the sign says we are looking for at our booth. and then ""not much CAD training"" which makes sense because the civil major didn't focus much on CAD when I was in school either. Hell I'm the ""CAD guy"" in my office but I barely knew anything when I got hired 6 years ago. 

So other than trying to rate their personalities, I don't really know how to gauge who we should put on a list for calls/interviews for internships or full time, and who to let go. They all sort of blend together after 50+ conversations.",AskEngineers,1644848768

That is, I set up their entire component library, set-up their schematics and drawing templates, did their system architecture, block diagrams, schematic captures, layout, antenna impedance matching, harmonic filtering, and performed other various testing – all of which was executed at very fast, start-up rate speed.

I am on the doors of college entry and i still am figuring out my major in this pressuring stressful late time.

But now, for personal circumstances i am forced to suddenly get all out independently to this world. And let me say it upfront i have zero knowledge or background or vision of any technical work experiences including all stem. By so, it is not that im not good at it, im really good. I just don't know anything outside of the confines of a classroom wall, nothing. I've been solid on a humanities major since all my life is writing, music and art but since money and employment opportunities is really important for me and i cannot afford a financial stressful situation, i am rethinking everything now. I know humanities and arts can make money and all, but we can't run from the fact that it takes effort, a type of effort other majors dont go through. 

Anyways, i want the anti-humanities people here. I wanna see your view on this. I've heard the pro-humanities a lot and i myself am a humanities person and noone can argue humanities are more connected to a human experience. but i wanna see the humanities people out there who are against majoring in humanities and how did you implement humanities into stem afterwards or perhaps undersatnding how to divide them.

TCP/IP retransmissions and awful performance when sending lots of small packets from multiple microcontrollers,"I'm having some trouble with a system I am trying to create at work.

I have two STM32 microcontrollers running the LWIP stack connected via Ethernet to a simple unmanaged switch. This switch is then connected to a computer. Both microcontrollers are socket clients on two different ports. Microcontroller A is sending a 8 byte message at a rate of 10hz to the host computer. Microcontroller B is waiting for a 16 byte message from the host computer. The host computer is running two socket servers in entirely separate processes to act as a controller for both of these microcontrollers.

Here's the problem. Microcontroller A works fine at all times, all of the messages are correctly received by the computer. This even works fine when I increase the rate from 10hz to as high as 40hz. Microcontroller B also works fine when connected by itself, it successfully receives messages from the computer quickly. However. As soon as I connect microcontroller A, microcontroller B seems to be unable to receive packets. I initially thought this was some sort of threading issue on the computer end, but after viewing wireshark, it seems that when microcontroller A is connected, the packets to microcontroller B get stuck retransmitting a bunch of times. Sometimes they are eventually received with a delay of 10-15 seconds but most packets just get lost altogether. Here's a screenshot of wireshark showing the retransmissions: https://imgur.com/4YJWGCB ([192.168.125.13](https://192.168.125.13) is microcontroller A, [192.168.125.11](https://192.168.125.11) is microcontroller B)

Pursuing a MEM as opposed to a MBA is definitely not common but my reasoning for applying is because:

\- Able to graduate from a school that name carries more.  If I apply for online MBA programs, the schools would be lesser known.

\- My field (supply chain) works closely with engineers.  This could be helpful in the future.

\- Would have ""engineer"" associated with me.  Could help set me apart from others.

\- Duke's MEM curriculum is customizable and not as technical as other MEM programs (from what I've read)

\- Do not have to take GMAT or GRE

\- Cost is less compared to online MBAs with similar recognition.

I have an Isometric exercise machine that is based around what I believe is a big load cell, with a digital strain gauge readout used to show force applied to the machine. (I'll add pictures if this will let me, unsure if it will!)

Load cell is a large aluminum bar attached to the underside of the machine with two large bolts that run through brass fittings. The cell itself is two smaller pieces of aluminum (I think) attached with screws, and a small wire element across one portion, where the gauge clips to. 

After a move a few years back, the display stopped measuring anything; it turns on and can be zeroed out, but it doesn't register anything happening. The wires are all in good condition (the box the gauge was contained in no longer is, but no electronics were damaged when opening it to look around inside)

I'm trying to repair this, as I don't know that I can figure out how to attach or program a new one, and from what I can tell a replacement gauge would be pretty expensive.

"When you shut off your car, do your air vents intakes close up automatically, sealing the cabin? Couple claim they almost died after being locked inside in their car which was off and parked and it got in the news.","I mean the vents that intake fresh air from outside to feed to the cabin. A couple in New Zealand claim they got locked inside their brand new Mazda which was parked in a garage, with the engine off, and the windows rolled up. They were in the car from seven pm at night to seven pm in the morning. They tried to break the window but couldn't, and they couldn't turn on the engine to open up the vent because they didn't have the key fob. When they got inside the car, it automatically locked, then they remembered they didn't bring the key fob inside with them. By the time they were found they were almost dead from oxygen deprivation. There's limited studies on ventilation in stationary cars that have the vents open but the one I found said the air exchange rate is about ten to twenty times per hour if the vents are open, but as low as zero point zero one air changes per hour if the vents are closed. The studies showed an air exchange rate of ten times per hour was more than enough to sustain four people and carbon dioxide levels didn't rise at all. But when the vents were shut, carbon dioxide rose very quickly. In these tests the cars were stationary and the windows were up. Since their car was off I'm wondering if the vents were automatically closed, and if this is just a one off thing or if it's normal for most new cars to do this. Also if this is the case, why automatically shut the vent when the car is off? Shouldn't it be considered a hazard in case people accidentally end up locked in the car and can't escape? Is this a design flaw?",AskEngineers,1644780986

In an alternator, the ""solenoid"" (can I call it that? The diagrams all show a solenoid design) has iron ""teeth"" on the outside, with one side of teeth becoming north pole and the other south pole terminals, then the whole thing rotates.

Is Mechanical Engineering Increasingly a Lousy Profession?,"Hi All,

I've been working as an ME for a small-mid manufacturing company for a few years and I can't help but increasingly feel that mechanical engineering a profession that people should be looking to leave as soon as possible.  Here are my reasons behind it:

1.  Compensation. According to this link, being a mechanical engineer is the 102nd best paid profession in the country: [https://www.careeronestop.org/Toolkit/Wages/highest-paying-careers.aspx](https://www.careeronestop.org/Toolkit/Wages/highest-paying-careers.aspx).  While that may place it in the top quarter, do you really think that Mechanical Engineering is the 102nd hardest major or job?  Do you really think that Mechanical Engineers work less hard or contribute less value than makeup artists or statisticians?  When you factor in pensions, overtime, and job security, there are many mechanics, plumbers, electricians, police officers, firefighters, etc getting paid way more.  Not saying that they don't deserve to be paid well or get overtime, but shouldn't we as well? 
2. Respect.  In my company, not a single person in the management team has a technical background.  They are all outside hires with a business or MBA background.  I don't feel like they really appreciate the level of effort that it takes to become or be an engineer.  It's also very telling that even the most inexperienced sales person is getting easily paid $20-30k a year more than a relatively experienced engineer.  Not saying that they don't add value, but don't engineers as well?  I always thought compensation was determined by value added, scarcity, and the difficulty of getting trained or doing the job.  Is learning a company's product line or learning sales techniques really more difficult than Calculus?  Engineers are often seen as overhead and an expense to be minimized.  Funny how I never hear the same logic applied to CEOs, sales mangers, HR managers, legal consul, etc.  They seem to demand respect.  It seems like they take the attitude of ""Pay me this or I leave.""  I feel that if an engineer pulled that, they would be fired very quickly.  When COVID hit and the company had to make cuts, they laid off 2 out of my team of 5 (one engineer, one project assistant) along with other engineers in other parts of the company.  It wasn't until nearly 9 months later my compensation was increased by 10%, still far less than the people they dumped.  They took advantage of the pandemic and the fact nobody dared to quit their job, and then tried to rectify their mistake after the recovery was faster and stronger than expected.
3. Budget.  Tying in with 2, it seems like the budgets are often limited.  I've never managed a project, but from what I have heard from those who have, the attitude is often, ""Work with half of what you requested.""  While budgets are very important, it seems quite an insulting way to manage it.  If you think a project is worth it and someone gives you a few cost estimates, either take one or don't bother  with the project if it isn't worth it.  Saying to work with less seems to take the attitude of either ""You don't know what you are doing"" or, ""You can just bust your ass to get it done, and if not, there's the door.""  I can't imagine a clinic or hospital asks their doctors or surgeons to use half as much anesthetic or sutures, or a law firm asking a lawyer to spend less on paying for critical case research or court fees, without which the case is sunk.  The same with contractors.  You try hiring a GC or a plumber or electrician and you start nickel and diming every piece, they wouldn't waste the time on you.  It's essentially, ""I'm plenty busy.  Do you want the job done or not?""  Given how hot the housing market is, I've heard plenty of cases where contractors left the project half finished to get a more lucrative one, especially if the client is a pain in the ass.
4. Opacity.  I find it rather tough to come up with how valuable I am.  For a salesperson, it's pretty easy.  You sell $10 mil in units, then you are 10x as valuable as someone who sells $1 mil.  Not saying you will get 10x the salary (it seems many companies would rather just hire 10 sales people at 1/10th the cost, less risky than having 1 superstar jump ship or retire).  For me, can I put an exact dollar value on selecting part a over part b?  Can I really say, ""I was able to know that this part goes here, so that is worth $x?""
5. Outsourcing: Unless you work in defense, construction, or manufacturing something that isn't worth or can't be shipped (which will become fewer and fewer as international shipping gets cheaper every year), the production lines are heading overseas.  The low cost of labor, lax regulations, national focus on STEM in countries like China and India, increasingly capable local talent, supply chains, subcontractors, etc is just too good for business.       
 Plus, you will be getting into an increasingly affluent local market by getting your name out and injecting hard currency into your workers, who will then buy what you are selling.
6. Other Countries: I would like to keep myself open to living abroad, but it seems engineering is even less well paid in other countries.  The difference isn't as bad in Canada and mining engineers in places like Australia can do very well, but I was shocked at how low salaries can be in otherwise expensive markets.  It seems like the UK is one of the worst offenders.  How the hell can they attract people when the salary for a chief engineer tops out at about    
**£** 65,000 or $88,000.  Sure, they don't have to pay out of pocket for healthcare, university is cheaper, and their work-life balance is better, but London is still crazy expensive, and the taxes are higher across the board.
7. General trends: It may be selection bias, but it seems that more and more people are moving away from this profession.  The most popular major in college is business, followed by healthcare, and then social sciences. Add some technical electives in project management, IT, some certifications, and you can easily make as much or more than an engineer with much less effort.  Some of my classmates have moved into things like finance, project management, cloud computing, etc.  This is even more apparent at the top schools.  One of the top members of my class went to work for one of the Big 4 and now works at FAANG, probably making 3x+ what I am making.  We see what's happened at companies like Boeing, GE, etc.  The beancounters take over, force the technical people to cut corners, fire a bunch of them when things go wrong, and ride off into the sunset with tens of millions in severance.

Perhaps I am looking at this all wrong or just need to find a new employer.  I still love the concept of engineering and I like many of the actual day to day aspects of the job and other positions I could potentially have.  But at the same time, I don't want that to wind up being a license to rip me off blind.   
 Housing has increased nearly 15% in a year where I live, with the typical home easily costing 5x the median household salary, assuming two full time workers, and not even considering childcare costs, student loans, etc.  There are only so many job hops you can make in your career, even without any external factors like kids, layoff, illness, etc.

An explainer on diesel-electric drive please!,"Hi all.

This will be an incredibly simple question for those with some knowledge which, as you can imagine, is not me.

I understand the basics of them - an ICE drives some electric motors. But I wasn't sure about the why? Why wouldn't the diesel engine be used alone? Was this a packaging thing? It simply wasn't practical to fit a diesel engine where it needed to be, so they'd rather wire some electric motors to it? I'd imagine a diesel engine could be run at its optimal engine speed for efficiency and let the electric motors do its work?

Take for example an old WW2 era tank I read about. Diesel electric drive. Would that have been able to run for as long as it had diesel? Or would the diesel engine be used to charge batteries which would have fed the electric motors? Excuse my waffle and general vagueness!

Mech &amp; Electrical engineers please help! I'm in desperate need of your input.,"Hi love,

I've been torn between returning to school for a master's degree in electrical engineering or mechanical engineering.

I have a bachelor's degree with a double major in chemistry and physics, and I figured they'd come in handy in my mechanical engineering course, particularly in thermodynamics and materials. But the trouble is, I've heard of a lot of individuals who want to transition out of their vanilla ME jobs to something like software dev and finance, even the aerospace folks want to break away and go for software and other more stable employment; plus, aerospace jobs are non-existent where I live ( Australia).

I know it sounds corny, but I've always wanted to work with NASA/JPL on their space exploration project, but because I'm not a US citizen, I still hope I could participate as an intern there and have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work on something extraordinary. But I'm not so convinced that will happen because the competition is tremendous; hundreds of thousands of aero/mech/elec students want to intern there. I attempt to contact someone at NASA via LinkedIn, but I don't have any values, so they don't respond, and I don't think there's any need for them too. Sorry for going off on a tangent, but the possibility of working/interning at NASA is one of the main reasons I chose ME. Keep in mind that I am not an American.

Now that I'm thinking about EE, I'm really curious about what it can do with power systems and signal processing, especially the latter. Imagine being able to create a device that can listen to any signal I desire. Plus, I'm a big fan of Adruino and have been working on several projects of my own, even if they're only simple small gadgets. Furthermore, what enticed me to EE is that I would be trained in advanced probability and mathematics, which will aid me in finding data-related careers without having to abandon my engineering studies and get a CS degree.

However, there are a few factors holding me back from choosing EE:

\- Will I be capable of passing the EE exams despite the fact that I believe I am a dumb person who cannot think quickly; I am a slow thinker who is always being unnecessarily cautious before making judgments.

\- Yes, I have a physics degree, but it's in electrodynamics theory, which I have an okish grade (B), but I wasn't at the top of my game, and I worked so hard for it; my cohort managed to achieve an A with a breeze. I realised I would not be a great physicist. Now it would be even more difficult for me to excel in my electrical engineering career?

\- After two years of not studying, I've forgotten how to integrate some of the inverse and trig functions, let alone the Fourier and Laplace transforms. I'm concerned about the math. I am working on some textbooks now to catch up, but given a daytime job as well as learning programming, and having to spend time with my family, I don't have a whole lot of energy and time to catch up fast enough. 

Please, both mechanical and electrical engineers, could you give me some advice about which path should I devote to? This issue has been bothering me since last year, I still couldn't decide what to take.

Second interview should be coming up...,"So I had a teams interview with two PEs at a company on Friday, mostly technical and ""tell us about yourself"" kinds of questions. Interview seemed to go decently well, but I know I could've done better.

Context is that the HR lady who contacted me about the first interview went on vacation and should be back by Monday.

What kind of career am I looking for?,"Hey all,

So I'm in my last semester of Computer Engineering.

So far, the classes I've enjoyed the most have involved designing circuits and doing low level programming. 

Some examples:

Designing circuits with purely analog components. My final projects included a robot that could navigate around obstacles using IR LEDs, phototransistors, and MOSFET logic, as well as an old school ""strobe"" guitar tuner.

Designing circuits that interface with microcontroller/processors. Taking some kind of sensor input, processing it, and doing something with it. It's just a ton of fun.

Similar to above, but with FPGAs/Verilog.

Research has led me to believe I would want to focus in Embedded Systems.

However, I've been interning with a company for the last two years, and my job technically fits under the umbrella of Embedded Systems. But these systems are very complex, utilizing multiple machines in a large network, running equally complex software, and I spend most of my time working at a level that's far more ""abstracted"" than what I'm interested in.

If I'm interested in working closer to the hardware/software interface, what exactly should I be looking for?",AskEngineers,1644713148
Why can thermoelectrics not be used to transport heat long distances?,"My understanding of how a thermocouple works is that if the junction end is at a different temperature than the wire ends at the base, an electrical voltage will be generated between these two base ends. What's especially cool is that even if the intervening length of thermocouple wire hosts a variety of other temperature gradients along its length, this will not affect the temperature measurement. Thanks to the linear relationship between dT and dV in the Seebeck effect, all these interim temperature differences cancel out so the end net voltage just depends on the difference in temperature between the two ends (the junction and the base wires) regardless of what's happening between them.

The effect is also reversible: if you flow a current through the thermocouple, you will generate a temperature difference (heating or cooling at the junction, as compared to the base wires).

My question is why can this not be used to easily move heat long distances like a heat pump? Why can I not make a really long thermocouple wire (meters... kilometers...), put the junction in a target ""hot tank"" far away with the base wires in a target ""cold tank"" next to me, then drive electrical current through the wires, and in so doing pump heat from my cold tank to the hot tank? During all the intervening distance the energy is being transported via charge carriers, so you're not at risk of the energy dissipating into the environment as with say steam pipes. You don't need to thermally insulate the wires (just electrically insulate, which is way easier). You can leverage all the conveniences of electrical power transport except now for heat. I assume there must be a catch, otherwise this would be commonplace.

I realize you could just stick a resistor in the hot tank and do Joule heating using electricity, but I'm also interested in being able to actively cool (i.e. for the ""cold tank"" end).",AskEngineers,1644709585
Preventing CO2 cartridge from overheating inside student-made rocket hatch?,"Hello!

However, as we plan to launch the rocket and engage the cartridges in warmer environments, we're concerned about the depressurization of our cartridges due to the high ambient temperatures inside the rocket.  
It can get critical past the 45 C (113 F) mark.

"""Rifling"" a gauss cannon?","I've watched a few really interesting gauss cannon projects.  They're really fascinating near future-tech.  The problem I see with every version is that the projectile comes out and begins tumbling.  

Now, obviously the projectile doesn't touch the barrel of the gun, so traditional rifling would be useless.  

My idea is to either have a paramagnetic side (1/4, /18. 1/16, whatever) to the ferromagnetic slug, wrap a paramagnetic wire around the slug, or have the slugs printed like polymagnets.  

In my mind this would encourage spin in the projectile.

Question about springs and Conservation of energy,"I'm not sure if you are familiar with a safety lancet , basically its something like this
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YwpJc6Ii8OM


Just wondering if the device(as it is or with some modifications) in the video could somehow :

1)be fired (by being pressed down onto someones skin)

2)compress itself back to a near fully compressed state after it reached its maxed extended state and started returning(&gt;99%, almost no losses whatsoever like extremely extremely small) where the plastic hooks could hold it back in place (imagine the spring rebounding and the hooks being allowed to return to their original position because the user has stopped applying pressure to the persons skin thereby allowing the hooks to return to their original position  therefore recapturing the spring in its original position)

Best example i can think of is an automatic gun where the firing pin is ready to strike the primer of the bullet again without manually compressing the hammer like in a revolver , i know a gun uses the recoil from the cartridge explosion to reload just the closest thing i can think of

All this without any other intervention , solely the device as it is. Maybe some sort of system with extremely low losses? So low that the spring is retracted to almost the same height as it started from. I know there would be a ton of calculations to get the spring to return just as the hooks were returning back ot their original position , just wondering if this is possible. In my head if the losses were extremely small to the point you could barely even see the losses this would be possible because the hooks would recapture the spring replacing the energy lost to friction and piercing of the skin , but i have minimal knowledge of physics &amp; engineering and wanted to ask the experts.

Not trying to design a reusable lancet. Just want to know if its possible. I know safety lancets are for the most part designed to be single use. I just feel that if the losses were extremely small it would be possible

Has anyone ever been part of a company where they are implementing automation/technology too quickly?,"Hi all - looking for advice here. I’m a project manager for a warehousing/e-commerce start up. I’m rather new, but come from a larger, established e-commerce company. At this start up, we’re building incredibly fast and growing at a rapid rate. However, we’re starting to purchase automation &amp; robotics without really any set background processes or SOPs established on the current state. 

I fear that we may be moving too quickly without getting current warehousing standards in play (we don’t have picking, replen, packing standards, etc..). 

So just looking for advice - is it normal to move this quickly and implement tech and just figuring out all processes on the side (and just flag risks)? Or should I call this out to my manager to see if we can pivot? I’m not really sure as I have never been in this situation before…

How much volume and energy would an electric personal buoyancy control device require?,"I study industrial design and have looked into diving equipment for my bachelor project. One idea I was playing with (conceptual, mind you), was to create an automated BCD for diving. The idea would be to essentially have a closed cylinder of gas, the volume of which could be altered by compressing the air with an electric motor (like a screw in a hole).

My question is, how much volume (of air) would be required to allow a diver to vary their depth from say 0 to 30 meters, and how much energy would be required to compress the air to this degree?",AskEngineers,1644680057

How do you have liquids move through a rapidly rotating structure?,"I've been looking at the structure of aircraft engines. I roughly get the gist of it. 

Stage 1: Compressor that rams air into the aircraft engine

Stage 2: Air is now compressed at least a dozen times over. It's now in a chamber

Stage 3: Air has 2 choices. It can go out through the burners, or go through another section of the engine that isn't in the combustion chamber

Stage 4: Fuel ignites and rapidly expands the air due to high temperature

Stage 5: Rapidly expanding air bursts out behind the plane, creating thrust. Combustion chamber is cooled with leftover air from stage 3. 

&amp;#x200B;

The question here is that I keep seeing mentions of some kind of turbine set after the combustion stage that takes in some of the energy from the rapidly exiting air and reroutes it somewhere. Some mention the compressor. This turbine requires incredibly high temperature alloys and requires vanes to be molded into it so that a cooling medium can flow through, because it'll melt otherwise. 

So... 

1. I keep seeing mentions of how turbines are so hard to build because they're subject to such high amounts of temperature and pressure. But the front compressor end of the turbine goes through things that are relatively mild (compress air by a huge amount) compared to the hellscape that is behind the combustion chamber. When they mention high temperatures, do they mean the back end turbine?
2. If you were to remove this back turbine, what would the effects be? I mean, the air has already been ignited, so unless its there to make the air spin even faster, all it is is some kind of energy-recovery mechanism. 
3. How do they keep the fluid from leaking out. It's a rapidly rotating piece of titanium. How do they keep it water/ liquid proof in the confines of a rapidly heating and rotating mass of metal.",AskEngineers,1644675919
Advice on how to resign from my current job.,"Warning this will be a long one and also my first post so I apologize in advance for any misspellings and typos.

Basically I have a boss who is considered to be toxic and he creates a toxic work environment.

People have been leaving my job recently left and right and my boss has gotten to a point to where when the last person put their two weeks notice in, he began to act irrate and basically lost his composure. That same last person that put in their two weeks was yesterday and I received a call from one of my other coworkers (who's planning to leave as well) who warned me about what to expect on Monday given how there are only 3 of us left.

They also explained how our boss personally told him to ask me and the other guy that's left if we knew about the other coworker putting her two weeks in, if we plan to leave, where we are going, if we are staying in field, and why are we leaving? He's basically going to sit us aside one by one and interrogate us which I personally don't feel comfortable with.

In the past-employee's exit interviews, they have mentioned why they wanted to leave and the problems/issues they had which was partly because of how he was as a boss. I know this because he chose to discuss the ex-employees exit interviews during our weekly meetings. I thought those were supposed to be confidential but I have no idea. Again, he would ask us one by one how we thought about the comments that were made in these said exit interviews but instead of us being asked in private, it was asked right on the spot in front of one another just before we started discussing workload.

I personally just started working at this firm 4 months ago and I'm looking to start working in the public sector. I'm also actively interviewing. I was planning on being respectful and coming forward to talk to him one on one first about my resignation and then submit my two weeks notice whenever I accept an offer. Given how has been acting as of recently due to others putting their two weeks in (who have also only been at the firm for no more than 6 months or so), I don't feel comfortable having to work with him if this is the energy he chooses to give. I understand why he may be anxious because he's losing his ""team"" but we don't feel like we're being treated as one.

Our HR has a history of not really recognizing the bs in our office or addressing the issues we personally bring to them that we may have. There's not much advocation for us as employees. I don't trust them to make those last two weeks bearable and I don't trust our boss to not be as aggressive as he was to the ex employees that left.

I originally came from another state and in the interview everything seemed fine (of course) and I was promised things out the gate but have yet to see any of them. Could be because I've only been there 4 months but my coworkers feel the same way. I even visited another office and everything seemed to pan out well but everything isn't as nice as it seems obviously.

I'm stuck on how to appropriately resign from this job without dealing with my boss. I am not one for confrontation or for being interrogated and I'm already disappointed with how things have been so far in my 4 months. Half of me would want to do the 2 weeks notice and keep it pushing to the end but the other half of me wants to resign immediately on a Friday and email my boss with a cc to HR. What is the best move to make?

Sidenote: I typically keep to myself and I don't tell everyone all of my plans pertaining to my career. So he wouldn't know who I'm looking to work for or where I'm looking to go as far as I know. I worked at a private firm before and I have come to realize my field has a tight circle to where someone knows another so I choose not to speak on it. I have many reliable references (both supervisors and coworkers) that I can use so I have no plan to keep my current boss as one, at all.

Estimating shear force due to torsion - dowel pinned flywheel,"Imagine locating a counterweight to the ends of a crankshaft with dowel pins. If i apply an instantaneous acceleration to the crankshaft (like dumping the clutch) what stress will I see at the dowel pins?  I want to size them correctly to handle the shear stress due to these impulse loads.   


Would i just calculate 

T = I\*dw/dt, (where I is the inertia of the flywheel) then divide by the radial distance the dowel pins are spaced apart to get a force acting at each dowel, and then divide by the area of the dowel pins to get the stress? Also, because they are counterweights, a centrifugal force will arise when the crank commences to rotate. This will also create some shear, but probably not as high as the initial impulse due to angular acceleration. Maybe this is a two step process. The connection will of course be bolted as well - maybe I can just assume the bolt preload will provide enough stiffness where the dowel pins do not even experience shear?",AskEngineers,1644672226

How come more rods in a cross flow heat exchanger cool the middle rod better?,"Hello, so yesterday we did an experiment with a cross flow heat exchanger and there were 4 columns filled with rods.

We also removed all the rods and left only the copper rod and it cooled much worse. How come? My only guess is that since the rods force the air into a gap, the pressure increases and so there are more air particles to pick up the heat.",AskEngineers,1644664955

Options to strengthen / reduce flex on folded flat bar,"Hi folks,

I'm working on an assembly that will be mounted to the end of a material conveyor. I'm down to designing the mounting that will hang the assembly from the conveyor frame and as I'm restricted on space and ""free area"", I'm trying to figure a way to strengthen the 15mm flat steel struts to avoid downward flex.

The strut (pink in the images) can be fixed on one end only (to ""fixed mount"" i.e. the conveyor frame) and will extend away from the fixed mount about 700mm. There will be 2 opposing c-channel bolted to the bottom of the struts and the assembly (approx. 150kg load) will be slid into the c-channels.

Cross-section showing one side: [https://imgur.com/a/P7RIOOc](https://imgur.com/a/P7RIOOc)

I can't add strengthening below the struts (where the c-channel is) as I need this clear to allow the assembly to slide in and out, I can work ""inside"" the struts as there will be material dropping here so I can only add strengthening on top of the struts ... with about 500mm clearance above to work.

My first idea is to laser-cut a 10mm gusset and weld it onto the top of the struts. I could even laser-cut notches into the struts so the gusset ""mates"" down into the struts.

Gusset draft: [https://imgur.com/a/4KZlBze](https://imgur.com/a/4KZlBze)

Will such a gusset realistically add much strength to the struts to avoid them flexing downwards? Another option might be to weld a ""hypotenuse"" onto the struts to close out the triangle. Again, would this help stop downward flex? A third option - but one I want to avoid - is I could lay another 15mm strut on top of each strut so I'd then have 30mm which might give a bit of rigidity.

Happy to hear any and all ideas or if there is a ""go to"" solution for avoiding flex in flat bar.",AskEngineers,1644624364

"Huge Difference in Salary Between the US and UK, Why and How to Overcome It?","Hi,

I am en route to a Bachelors degree in Electronics Engineering. I would like to work in London, but have noticed a massive disparity between salaries compared to the US or other EU countries. According to [payscale.com](https://payscale.com/) the average base salary for an Electronics Engineer in the US is around $60,000-80,000, while it is only around $40,000 (or even less) in the UK. I thought these figures were wrong at first, but after hours of looking at job offers they seem to be completely true. I love London, and would like to work here, but seeing as I could be paid double the US seems very appetizing. I have a few questions regarding these discrepancies however, namely:

1. What is causing this huge difference in salary? Is it just basic supply and demand, or is it something else? I get that living costs, taxes, etc are different amounts in these areas, but it still seems like a huge difference.
2. Secondly, is there any way to overcome this? What should I be looking for when searching for a job in the UK to find one with a better salary?

Coworker hard to ignore when doing tasks/discussing,"Both coworker and I started working in the same company in November and then December for me. Both entry level positions, same role basically just multipled by 2. 

Coworker named ""H"" always shows up when I am listening to instructions from my supervisor, showing my supervisor something, asking, etc. Literally not joking, he will stand next to my supervisor while we are in a discussion. Now, normally I understand this happens if someone also needs boss's attention and is just hanging out waiting for their turn. This is not the case. H just wants to know what I'm doing. And wants to join the conversation when it has nothing to do with his tasks. 

Example, showing supervisor something on my desk with some parts, he gives insight, we are both sitting down and there's H standing behind us like a creep. 

Other example, supervisor directly takes me into the shop where we need to perform a test. H, who was not asked and is not working on this project, gets up and follows us. Supervisor seems kind of peeved because he intentionally set up 2 different tests, one would be for H, one for me.  

I feel there is a difference between wanting to learn and observe what his colleagues are doing, but he is just becoming a nuisance and a lot of the things he is barging into are like me asking boss ""hey what screwdriver do you have over there?""

Need help with developing tool,"Hi,

I am currently trying to make a spanner kinda like the this: [https://imgur.com/a/WK906SD](https://imgur.com/a/WK906SD)

It is designed for M10 and M12 bolts/nuts (17mm and 19mm diameter).

The issue i am facing is what to make the internal diamater of each holes on the spanner.

My thinking is that if i make it the exact same as the diameter of the nut it will be hard to take the spanner on and off. The other issue is if the nut/bolt is slighlty damaged, the spanner wont be able to fit on at all. 

On the other hand, if it is too larger, it might cause uneven ware on the bolt and damage it, or be too lose and the bolt will slip through.

I have made 2 prototypes and they seem ok, but if i am going to make several, i would like to make sure the internal diameter is based off research rather than how it feels, as i may be overlooking something.

To understand just how overbuilt it is, I went looking for online deflection calculators but they're all assuming a center load, while the feet of my table experience torque (in a worst case scenario). The feet are 9in long from center of table and the deck is 12, so there's mechanical advantage that I can take into account (I did some rudimentary engineering on high school) but I have no idea how a carver load deflection covers to deflection under torque.

[Calculators](https://imgur.com/a/AHLStlc) say easily 4000lbs before deforming per leg in deflection (given a point load on center). Ignoring the mechanical advantage from the deck, What does that mean for the torque strength where the tube is fixed on one end and the load is on the other?

What is the ideal technical skill to learn for a young manufacturing/mechanical engineer,"I am a 21 year old engineer halfway through my course and I am currently at the point where I decide which optional courses I can take for the rest of my course. 

The ideal course is of course something I enjoy and would continue to enjoy for the rest of my engineering career but would also make me good money. I am qualified in milling, turning and CAD but could do with some more work on the latter. I am very capable when it comes to mathematics/logic and I also really enjoy it too which is a plus. So from this, it would seem to me that learning how to use a CNC is the best option as it aligns well with my capabilities and with what I enjoy. However, the average salary for a CNC machinist is roughly £30,000 and I want to go for a profession with a much higher salary ceiling and average salary. While I am young, I don’t mind picking a career path I don’t enjoy as much so that I can make decent money to set myself up later in life. The end goal for me is to become a highly skilled and qualified engineer with a well paying job that can also travel abroad for work.

List of type of engineer jobs,"Is there a somewhat comprehensive list of types of engineering jobs ?  Of course the field is probably too varied to list them all.

For me the big type of engineering jobs I managed to come across :

\*R&amp;D engineer

\*Project Engineer (closely related to R&amp;D engineer, but less pure design work more project management)

\*System Engineer (the actual definition &amp; responsibilities seem to vary a lot from industry to industry and company to company)

\*Service engineer (=After-sales engineer or customer support engineer)

\*Sales Engineer

\*QA Engineer

\*....?

Of course this type of list is to be taken with a pinch of salt, as depending on location, industry &amp; companies the titles and exact responsibilities of those jobs might be quite different. Also we might ask the question of how far we stretch the definition of engineering (for instance: an engineer working as a manager is nonetheless an engineer by formation, but I wouldn't say he is doing an 'engineering job')",AskEngineers,1644568653

To give some back story, I work at a small company with two other engineers. They both have said they are leaving in the next 3 months due to bad experiences with the company. I know that I am not ready to be the only engineer at this company since I had no experience before this.

The reason the other engineers are leaving is because management interferes with designs excessively. Ex. I almost finished my first project, but they had design ideas and wanted me to change it multiple times.

Another random thing is that I found out this company has been in trouble for messing with employee wages multiple times. They also refuse to listen to the other engineers reccomendations as they want to save money in the short term at the expense of customers.

My team is having difficulty communicating with him and training him on the ins and outs of the technical side of the product and general good engineering practice. I have a feeling he's lost in meetings, both in person and over Teams. I am not sure how much of what we and the customers communicate to him gets through. He seems to always be lagging a few days behind with developments on the programs we support. He constantly mixes up technical details when we are troubleshooting, and will pitch ideas that have no relevance to the issues at hand. 

My teammates and I do not know sign language, but we do our best to try and communicate effectively with him. I believe he can hear some, and when combined with lip reading that allows for some face to face communication. I try the following things to be as accommodating as possible:

* Speak clearly and a bit slower than I normally would
* Draw lots of diagrams on a whiteboard
* Follow most conversations up with re-enforcing messages in Teams to make sure he understood what was said in person

Unfortunately, I'm not sure this is enough as he is still not developing his technical knowledge and keeping pace with the work. Additionally, my team and I can't be expected to summarize every meeting or conference call if he is not able to understand what is being discussed.

I keep hearing about children and dogs suffocating in locked cars and I swear I never heard of this being a problem back in the nineties. Is the cabin air filter blocking the vent to blame?

To keep it short, i've been thinking more and more often on making a little adjustment on my career, more specifically, combining manufacturing and shop-floor know-how with software solutions (ERP; MES; Industry 4.0 and so on...).

My software skills are way below average, therefore they will be my main focus throughout the following months. The problem is that i don't know where to start. This field is so complex and dense that i just don't know where to begin creating my learning plan. I'm not looking to be an expert in multiple languages. I'm looking to learn and invest on the languages that could add the most value to my career objective.

I don't know anyone with this type of role that i could talk to, so i kindly ask some advices on the following questions:

1) Which programming language (s) should i invest my time on?

2) Which complementary tools should i also invest my time on (Database technologies, IT systems or important concepts...)

3) Anything you consider important and that i should keep my on?

Please feel free to discuss or criticize what i just wrote. All the feedback is welcome and greatly appreciated. I'm just trying to create a realistic and objective plan.

Looking for an oxygen sensor with a fast response time,"Working on a project that requires interfacing an oxygen sensor with a fast response time (1 to 5s) which comes with a built-in serial interface (i.e. UART). That's the main requirement but ideally the measurement range should be 0-100% VOL.

So far I found this sensor:

[https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Oxygen-Sensor-Pro-Pre-calibration-p-4896.html](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Oxygen-Sensor-Pro-Pre-calibration-p-4896.html)

which comes with a built-in MCU, UART, measuring range 0-25% VOL, relatively cheap, but high response time of 15s

I also found this other sensor:

[https://shop.maxtec.com/product/biomed-and-service/fio2/medical-oxygen-sensor/max-23/](https://shop.maxtec.com/product/biomed-and-service/fio2/medical-oxygen-sensor/max-23/)

which has a measuring 0-100% VOL, fast response time of 1.5 - 3s, more expensive, and also out of stock for 2 months. It comes with a 3-pin Molex connector though, which would require being interfaced via the mcu's adc.

As an in-between solution, there's this other one:

[https://shop.maxtec.com/product/biomed-and-service/fio2/medical-oxygen-sensor/max-17/](https://shop.maxtec.com/product/biomed-and-service/fio2/medical-oxygen-sensor/max-17/)

Cheaper than the second but a bit pricier than the first; somewhat fast response time of less than or equal to 8s, in-stock, but would also require being interface through the mcu's adc rather than having a built-in serial protocol.

Calculating cost savings of insourcing manufacturing a part?,Obviously the main thing is the  difference in supplier cost of finished product vs the cost of buying raw material directly.

Does this sound like burnout to you?,"We do a lot of seat of your pants design stuff at my job. When I first started, this was awesome, it was basically a fresh grad's wet dream. Have a meeting, find out what you need to do. Whip something up in cad, prototype it, wash rinse repeat for a few months until you have something that's actually manufacturable. Cool, right?

Now, a few years later, whenever someone comes up to me with a design they want done, I think something along the lines of ""great, now I have to design this shit."" Looking back at how much I used to enjoy engineering, I'm confused. Why would I feel this way about something I supposedly enjoy so much?

I started trying to think about problems with my job that might be making me feel this way, but I can't really come up with anything. While we often work on an accelerated schedule, deadlines usually aren't hard, we never get chastised or demeaned for doing something wrong, we get plenty of paid time off and flexible hours. And the pay is good. So this has to be my problem, right?

Why do men talk over me/ignore me in group projects?,"Female engineering student here. Not all guys do this, but I've never had a women do this to me. I have many instances where I'm in a group project with men and they would either talk over me, ignore me, or interrupt me when I'm presenting my ideas/solutions/suggestions. 

For example, I was in a group with one girl and two guys for physics, and I noticed the guys only talked to each other. One time we were all struggling with a problem and I wrote down my solution knowing well that I read about it in the textbook and was pretty sure it was the right answer. One of the guys also had a solution written down. When I presented my answer/work to them, they didn't say anything and the one guy started presenting his solution to the other guy. I was irritated because I was pretty sure I was right. The professor stops at our desk and he proceeds to ask questions that will guide us to the answer. Every time he asked I answered correctly while the guys remained silent and eventually I showed him my calculation and he said I was correct. The guys THEN looks over at my work and asks ""how did you do it????"" 

Another example is in my junior design team with two other guys. Every time I start speaking one of the guys will interrupt and talk over me or blatantly ignores my remark while talking mostly amongst each other. I started to feel really irritated because they kept talking over/interrupting, so I continued to talk, slightly increasing my volume, the next time they interrupted and talked over me and they kept talking for a bit until they finally noticed what I was doing and stopped/listened. It pissed me off.

"Advice on choosing a motor for high torque, low speed, high precision project","Hello everyone!

I'm an EE student doing an internship where I'm designing a system to test antenna arrays, and currently I'm stuck with the mechanical part of the project. This consists of some type of motor controlled by a microprocessor (probably a raspberry-pi) that rotates a structure which the antennas attach to. It has to follow the next requirements:

\- The angle must rotate with a resolution of at least 1 degree.

\- It has to be able to rotate a setup of a maximum of 150 kg (the setup varies in size and weight, but the heaviest one can be contained in an imaginary cylinder of roughly 0.2 m radius and 1 m height).

\- The system needs to have feedback of the current angle at which the setup is positioned.

\- Speed isn't relevant as the rotations will generally be in short steps (around 10 degrees max).

I'm clueless on how to choose a motor that satisfies my requirements, particularly determining the necessary torque of the motor. I thought of modelling the setup as a solid uniform cylinder of the size mentioned above, with it estimate the moment of inertia and obtain the torque by assuming certain value for angular acceleration and velocity. Would this method give a good reference for the torque needed? if it does, how should I estimate a real maximum angular acceleration for the torque? Maybe there is a better way to calculate the torque?

Also, from what I've searched, there are stepper and servo motors for precise angle position. Appareantly steppers are eassier to control but less precise and have missteps when the load is high. Which type of motor would be recommended? I've only seen stepper motors with 200 or 400 steps, are there motors with higher step counts or should I consider microstepping to gain more precision?

How do you deal with “know it all” colleagues?,"I work as a SW engineer in a really small team at a research institute. It happens that one of my colleagues is a “Mr. Always Right” and wants everything done his own way otherwise it is wrong.
Last year we started implementing a new version of an IEEE specification in which he always wanted to deviate the implementation from what the specification says, like not implementing datasets and state machines, based on “they are not needed” and “as long as external interfaces are ok, the implementation is fine”. Even the ones he implemented had always a different logic from what was specified.
Since I only work part-time, I just ignored the behavior and did my part as close as possible to the spec as I did in previous companies. 
It happens that I took a long brake from work during Xmas and now I noticed he changed most of my implementation to his own way: renaming variables, reversing the logic, delete smaller functions reducing readability, etc.

How do vent caps and fans in series affect air changes per hour?,"Apologies if not the right flair. Please let me know if there is a better sub for this question.

### Step 1: Make your requirements less dumb

It doesn’t matter who gave it to you. It’s even more perilous if an intelligent person gave the requirements to you; you might not question them enough. Everyone is wrong some of the time, no matter who you are.

***Pro Tip:*** **Requirements must come from a person, not a department**: If you want to ask about the constraint, you cannot ask the department; you need to ask the person in that department. Following this puts the onus of ownership of that requirement on that person instead of an entire department.

### Step 2: Delete Part of the Process

If you are not adding things back 10% of the time, you are not deleting enough. Our bias tends to be towards adding steps in the process “in case” we need it. You can make ""in-case"" arguments about so many things that you will make this process cumbersome by adding too many steps.

### Step 3: Simplify or Optimize

The most common error of an intelligent engineer is to optimize something that shouldn’t exist. **Don’t optimize a thing that shouldn’t exist**. This happens because we have been trained to answer a question given to us by our teacher but not tell the teacher that the question is dumb.

### Step 4: Accelerate Cycle Time!

You are going too slowly; go faster but don’t go faster unless you have worked on the first three steps. If you are digging your grave, don’t dig it faster. That’s why it is essential to do the first three steps.

### Step 5: Automate

Finally, the last step is “automate.” Automation might not be the best idea in all cases. So choose wisely. First, get a human to do it, then try automating the process if the delta is big enough, only then do it. We often discount how good humans are at certain things. ",AskEngineers,1644514791

From what I have read of plasma furnaces it’s possible to siphon off materials based on density. But I’m not sure if the extra steps necessary to then refine those material and form them into ingots or spools would make sense or be profitable. 

The other gases given off during the burn process can also be captured but I am not sure what the purity of those gases are. I know that the furnace can use certain gases obtained during burn to offset fuel use. Again I’m not sure how feasible or profitable that would be.

i'm studying an engineering prep course for almost 4 months now with about 5 months more to go and with the hope to get in civil engineering degree. i honestly had really little preparation for academic studying during my life.... i didn't study for about 6 or 7 years and even in high school i wasn't doing my best. so i guess it make sense that it wont be easy.

the thing is, that it really is overwhelmingly hard at some points. i'm doing all that in my power to study. i go to lectures each day until 5 pm, than start doing homework and basically learning most if not all of the new topic by myself, because in both physics and math i'm never on pair with the teacher. i usually write what the teacher writes as fast as possible while trying to understand, but they most usually write 10X faster than me so i don't get to finish writing and understanding the material, and i see other students answering the questions immediately and just get mind blown from how far behind i am.

its been like that almost since the start and its not getting better. we are having maybe 6-8 different algebra topics, 2-3 in trigo and few different ones in physics, not to mention another class in english and another on scientific writing, almost each lecture as new things, even a day after the other lecture, and they don't go any slower during exam times. i feel like i just don't have enough time dosn't matter what ill do...

as time went by it also became harder and harder to go through the homeworks... as i mentioned, they usually give us homework for the newly learned material of the same day, until about the day after. and as the material getting harder, it got harder to do the homework by myself or with a studying group and now i usually use other learning methods.

i'v tried and still am multiple ways of studying. some days i went straight home and done homework by myself and other days went with classmate to the library, and i also use private teachers.

about a month a go classes transferred to zoom, and while still falling behind at least i had recordings witch helped me a lot to get better understanding. i thing that with unlimited time using recorded classes i would eventually made it. today i got notice about coming back to uni in a week from now and i'm bummed out out as fuck.

just to think about not having the recordings anymore and being again completely stuck, and forced to go throw full days in classes not understanding much of it just so i can go home tired and try to figure it all out from scratch... not to mention leaving the comfort of my parents house back to the dorms and waking up at least an hour early for the 30 minutes walk uphill each morning...

so, how normal is my situation? how many struggle this much?

what should i do to make my life easier? maybe there's something i'm missing or doing wrong?

also, what can i do to make the transfer back to classes as easiest as possible?

thank you all for reading thus far, i have a lot on my mind.

i'm studying an engineering prep course for almost 4 months now with about 5 months more to go and with the hope to get in civil engineering degree. i honestly had really little preparation for academic studying during my life.... i didn't study for about 6 or 7 years and even in high school i wasn't doing my best. so i guess it make sense that it wont be easy.

the thing is, that it really is overwhelmingly hard at some points. i'm doing all that in my power to study. i go to lectures each day until 5 pm, than start doing homework and basically learning most if not all of the new topic by myself, because in both physics and math i'm never on pair with the teacher. i usually write what the teacher writes as fast as possible while trying to understand, but they most usually write 10X faster than me so i don't get to finish writing and understanding the material, and i see other students answering the questions immediately and just get mind blown from how far behind i am.

its been like that almost since the start and its not getting better. we are having maybe 6-8 different algebra topics, 2-3 in trigo and few different ones in physics, not to mention another class in english and another on scientific writing, almost each lecture as new things, even a day after the other lecture, and they don't go any slower during exam times. i feel like i just don't have enough time dosn't matter what ill do...

as time went by it also became harder and harder to go through the homeworks... as i mentioned, they usually give us homework for the newly learned material of the same day, until about the day after. and as the material getting harder, it got harder to do the homework by myself or with a studying group and now i usually use other learning methods.

i'v tried and still am multiple ways of studying. some days i went straight home and done homework by myself and other days went with classmate to the library, and i also use private teachers.

about a month a go classes transferred to zoom, and while still falling behind at least i had recordings witch helped me a lot to get better understanding. i thing that with unlimited time using recorded classes i would eventually made it. today i got notice about coming back to uni in a week from now and i'm bummed out out as fuck.

just to think about not having the recordings anymore and being again completely stuck, and forced to go throw full days in classes not understanding much of it just so i can go home tired and try to figure it all out from scratch... not to mention leaving the comfort of my parents house back to the dorms and waking up at least an hour early for the 30 minutes walk uphill each morning...

so, how normal is my situation? how many struggle this much?

what should i do to make my life easier? maybe there's something i'm missing or doing wrong?

also, what can i do to make the transfer back to classes as easiest as possible?

thank you all for reading thus far, i have a lot on my mind.

tldr: didn't study most of my life, now prep class is very hard on me. i'm wondering how normal, good or bad is my situation and what should i do looking forward?",AskEngineers,1644507965

Recent MechE grad in a rotation program with no real MechE options,"So I joined a rotation program in the power grids/electric utility industry and although they hired many mechanical graduates, the rotations we have a chance at getting are not mechanical. Only one of the rotations options was in Mechanical R&amp;D, but because there is so much competition in my program for that role, even though I did a lot of networking with that team to try and secure that spot for myself, someone else in my program got it since the HR make final decisions on who gets what rotation. 

My last rotation was in Quality Engineering at a electrical transformer manufacturing plant (hated the location-in the middle of nowhere and I’m from a big city, didn’t like the job either), and my current rotation is in project coordination for an EPC business (engineering, procurement, and construction full turnkey projects). None of my rotation experience so far has been technical, and I’m afraid this might affect my career path down the road. There are some other mechanical design based roles but they are in manufacturing locations and I hated living in the middle of nowhere so I opted for this project coordination role as it was in a good location and would make for a diverse experience for me.  

I really badly want to do technical mechanical work in the aerospace industry, and I don’t want my diverse experience with Quality Engineering, EPC, and some other random non technical role to make me not so appealing to employers of mechEs in the aero industry. Can this be a problem for me when I’m later trying to get into a technical mechanical engineering role in aerospace, or am I stressing for no reason? I hope it doesn’t hinder my chances.",AskEngineers,1644506652

Grip Length of Fasteners in Blind holes - Is fully threading detrimental,"If I'm going to be bolting two plates together with M8 screws.

The first is 10mm thick and the second is 250mm (side of a tube), so needs to be a blind hole.

The original design had 25mm bolts in originally and they vibrated loose in short order. Done some reading on the topic and 50mm bolts should be the right stiffness to stay in place.

Currently my understanding is that, if we only deepen the tapped hole in the tube to allow for the 50mm bolt (so it's still a fully threaded hole in the tube all the way down start to finish), the joint will still only have an effective grip length of 14mm), and probably vibrate loose again; and how the design should be being modified, straight through the 10mm plate, 25mm clearance hole in the tube, 15mm tap at the bottom; as this gives 39mm grip length instead?",AskEngineers,1644504121

Looking for recommendations on high current DC marine connectors,"So the context:

I'm working on an autonomous catamaran (which will be used in both salt and fresh water) that uses LFP batteries to power 4 electric motors, with the max possible draw being roughly 170 amps (at 24V) total (two forward-propulsion motors pulling up to 120A, two steering motors pulling up to 50A), and I'm trying to find some connectors that'll be suitable to go on the outside of the battery boxes, which will sit relatively close to the water line and can expect to get splashed.

The key requirements:

- Should be able to fit 4AWG cable (our current inventory aside from far more anaemic mains and speaker cable).

- Should be capable of handling ***roughly*** 80A continuous, 170A burst (these numbers are based on manufacturer spec estimates for our motors), at 24VDC.

- Can be 1 or 2 pin (ie separate or merged +/- connectors, though ideally the latter).

- Should be water resistant to the equivalent of IPX5 (getting lightly splashed continuously for an indefinite period).

- *Ideally* should be capable of being mounted to / embedded onto the box (ie so there isn't a cable pigtail that needs its own set of cable glands where it exits the box). We are however open to the idea if something is cost effective but just not suited for being hard-mounted; it's mainly just about avoiding spending more money.

- The connectors will be in a warm environment, so no need to worry about icing, etc.

- The connectors should ideally *not* be right-angled due to the geometry involved, but it would be possible to use right-angled connectors if cost effective.

---

The LFP batteries came with Anderson plugs and I know they're somewhat water resistant (being used in external automotive applications), but I'm not sure how they fare with salt water, plus embedding a receptable into the box will probably involve epoxying one in, which would work but be a pain in the future if we wanted to replace it.

I've looked into Deutsch DTHD connectors and they're certainly capable, but also a bit expensive, especially because the ones in the current range I'm looking at tend to be single pin connectors, meaning I'd potentially need around 12 of them (might *maybe* be able them onto a BOM though).

I've also looked at various heavy duty connectors from Amphenol, Harting, etc (though obviously by no means have I looked at every single connector out there) but nothing seems quite what I need (either they lack IP ratings, or max out at around 20A, or they're super expensive, etc).

I've also looked at some EV (car) connectors and they're just way too pricy.

So does anyone have recommendations, suggestions, etc?

I'm open to jerry-rigging some solutions, like 3D-printing TPU sleeves, etc for certain connectors, but in general I'd like to have the option of being able to replace the connector on the box should it break, and without having to try and remove epoxy.",AskEngineers,1644499718

How to calculate the thickness of an object to pass a magnetic field through?,"At home I'm thinking about making a moving picture with ferrofluid

Rather than cut or get magnets the shape I need, I'm thinking I should get some magnets, stick them to magnetic objects (maybe ferrous sheets or iron/steel blocks) in the shapes that I need to pass the magnetic field through them so that I can make the picture that I want.

The issue is that I don't know how thick I would need the magnetic objects to be. They can't be paper thin or the original magnetic fields will overpower the shape, and they can't be infinitely deep because the magnetic field won't travel that far.

I’ve been working for a micromanager for a couple years now, and it gets to be extremely frustrating.  I am at the senior level, but in a daily basis he lashes out, twists my words, and treats me like a child.

Me: “Hey boss, did client X happen to send us data yet?”

Boss: “If they sent it, I would have told you.  What makes you think it’s a good use of time to come ask me?”

Me: “I didn’t think it was anything major, I just wanted to check.”

Boss: “There is a clear channel of communication for this.  We do not deviate from it.  You would have had the information if I had it, and the fact you’re asking me has me questioning if you even understand how communication is performed at this company.”

Me: “Okay understood, I’ll keep an eye out and get moving once we get the data.”

Boss: “Keep an eye on what?  I told you I would tell you.  I literally just walked you through this, and now you’re going to waste time digging for information we don’t have when the project is over budget?”

Me: “Sorry, it was just an expression.”

Boss: “Don’t walk away from this.  You should understand this by now.  *proceeds to berate me for 20 minutes”.

Two weeks later in client meeting…

Boss: “Thanks for sending the data two weeks ago.  ChemE2023 had completed the work, care to share?”

Me: “Oh the data came in?”

Boss (in front of client): “Yes, it was in the spreadsheet where we have always put it.  That was implied.  Why did you not go look?”

Me: Cries.

Qualifying Civil Engineering Experience for PE License,"Hello, 

I have recently revisited the journey obtaining my PE license (I am scheduled to take the FE exam in 2 months) but I still feel as though my path is not quite clear. I obtained my civil engineering bachelors degree in 2018. For 3 years I worked for a large General Contractor here in California, and at the end of last year I moved to a new city here in CA where I joined the Public Works Engineering division. In the the general contractor company I did  primarily in construction management roles (scheduling, estimating, field engineering, change management), though no design. I also never had a direct supervisor who had their PE license. Here at the public works I am working more on the development side , primarily doing civil work plan check reviews/approval for new subdivisions, encroachment permit approval which involves traffic control plan review and approval, and a few other permit review types, however again I’m not performing any direct design work. My director is a PE, and the deputy director is also a PE. I am conflicted because I believe it would be challenging to demonstrate qualifying experience. In the case I take the PE exam not long after passing the FE, I’d need to demonstrate qualifying work experience , so it seems as though much of my CM work may not contribute , and I’m unsure if my current work here would also benefit. I am now in a place where I’m debating if I would eventually need to join a firm that will allow me to get design experience and/or obtain a masters to also contribute to experience. My question is has anyone been able to use their experience in CM and/or public sector work (specifically in the plan check side) as experience. If so, how did you describe your work to demonstrate it?",AskEngineers,1644435573

Would it be unadvisable to do engineering research for two different professors in undergrad?,"(I apologize in advance for the word vomit, I’m an engineer for a reason) 

So I’m in a bit of a pickle and I need a little advice. A little background I’m in my senior-ish (I have an extra semester bc of my robotics minor) year of mechanical Engineering.  Spring 2021 I saw a posting looking for research assistants in biomedical robotics by Professor A. I contact her and eventually we start working a bit together. She was a very sweet woman but overall seemed a bit unorganized. My university was online at the time so all my work was virtual (I was doing mostly simulation and environment design) as well as she was a new professor at the university so her projects weren’t funded yet as well as I was the only person helping her at the time. Most of my work was unproductive as she didn’t really have direction for me as well as I didn’t really know what I was doing with not much resource of help. I wasn’t getting paid either which I didn’t mind bc I barely did anything. Skip to the summer and I’m in contact with her for a bit but since I started a full time internship we agreed to meet again at the end of the summer but we never did despite me reaching out. Right before my fall 2021 semester started I email her with no response at all. It’s our first semester back in person so it was a little chaotic and I wait until a couple weeks into the semester and email again, she still doesn’t respond. fast forward to almost a month and a half later she finally responds. She basically tells me she’s been busy but she has in person work for me and she’d love to meet. I say great and ask for her availability so we can figure out when to meet. No response for the rest of the semester.

Meanwhile a couple of my friends in my robotics minor classes who work for Professors B were telling me that she was looking for more research assistants in the mobile robotics lab as a bunch of hers graduated. It was a paid position too. I had taken classes with professor B before/am taking some with her now and she was great as well as I love mobile robotics specifically (I’m big into dynamic systems and controls). It was the end of the semester and I figured I had been ghosted professor A so I contacted her. Fast forward to now (spring 2022) and I am working a paid position under professor B. Most of my work is pretty light (like &lt;10hrs a week) and mostly coding stuff I do on my own with some lab work testing bipedal robots on terrain. Tho I’m not a huge fan of coding (I’m terrible at it) its been a lax and environment and overall a good experience.

Fast forward to a day ago where the issue comes in. I get an email from professor A. She said she finally had a funded project for a wearable device for brain trauma patients to help with mobility. she said she was looking for me to work on it with 3 other students she acquired. Most of the work would be device design as well as control design which is more to my specific skill set as I have a strong system design/CAD background. Overall the project seems a lot more organized and structured than what I was doing previously with her as well as its in collaboration with the campus psych dept. From what it looks like the position is unpaid but who know she hasn’t given me much detail beyond project plan.

I’m conflicted tho bc this project I feel I could work well in as well as I technically committed to professor A first. But at the same time I also like the work I’m doing now and I’m being paid by Professor B so obviously I’m more obligated to her. 

I’m wondering since the work I’m doing now is pretty light if it was possible to do both. From what I’ve read it’s pretty discouraged to work for two professors. But at the same time my situation is a little funky so I’m confused on what I should do. 

Any and all advice is appreciated

(TLDR: did unpaid virtual work for prof. A in spring 2021, when we went in person in fall 2021 I reach out a bunch and she basically ghosted me, I started doing paid research for professor B in spring 2022 as I was encouraged to by a few friends. Work is extremely light as well as mostly coding which I’m not very good at but it’s a good environment and I like it. prof. A finally contacts me again almost 6 months after our last interaction with an actual project geared more towards my skill set. Currently wondering if I can work both since my current workload is light under prof B., advice is very much needed lol)",AskEngineers,1644425932
Where are the actual engineering jobs?,"I'm an EE with 7years experience and am stuck in my career, any advice would be appreciated.

**TLDR**: Are there jobs that involve challenging EE work instead of the bureaucratic nightmare that I'm currently trapped in? and how do I find them?

**Background**: I left my previous company after a year of doing near zero engineering work, in my new company I'm finding myself in the same situation. 

**Experiences**: In my first job out of college I was writing firmware, designing 12-layer PCBs, troubleshooting at the component level, all my time was spent reading datasheets, it was great, but the pay was terrible and nowhere else to go within the company, so I moved on.  Since leaving that position, both companies I have been with since have had great pay, but the engineering work and internal bureaucracies are a joke.  Both job descriptions listed out the kinds of things I wanted to do, but I'm doing none of those.  From what I can see, any engineering work that does happen is completely hamstrung by mismanagement and internal bureaucracy.  I spend my time waiting for work and attending meetings where no one can determine an owner for otherwise very (VERY) simple problems that drag on for months.  I'm bored, not learning anything, and frustrated by the inefficiency.  

**Example**: We need a very basic PDU to upgrade a station.  I spec'd out the PDU (real straight forward).  I'm now a dozen meetings and two months in and I'm still giving presentations on it, not about technical requirements (no one wants to hear those) but because I need to explain that there is an old PDU, and due to internal standards, we need a new one.  I did this at my previous job, and I'm doing it again at my current one, I'm losing my mind.

**Current Outlook**:  I realize that I'm new to the company, not going to get the fun projects right away, but I am in the meetings where they are discussed.  The work is spread out over a committee people who'd rather spend more time shrugging their shoulders than having any technical discussion.  Any mention of this to management has been met with enigmatic ""work is coming"" with no elaboration or plans to prepare for that work.

**Future plans**: I don't want to make a habit of jumping jobs, that's no good for a resume, but I can't deal with the boredom, and feeling my skills languish from lack of use is killing me.   How do I find a job with challenging technical problems and the agency to solve them?  I'm considering going back to school, but haven't determined if that will help.  I'm also considering a career change, probably to software, or frankly, literally anything else.

Conclusion: How do I find a job with actual technical problems? or is my experience in the EE field just how it is?",AskEngineers,1644425906

Is going into management worth it?,"I'm still pretty young ( 3 years full-time experience) and I'm trying to see where I'll be in 10ish years.

In my work experience so far there are plenty of senior engineers with 10-15 years experience who seem to be satisfied career wise. But much fewer engineers with 15-30 years of experience and fewer still who seem happy/satisfied. Concerningly, when I look for more senior jobs on job boards, very rarely do they ask for more than 10 years experience. I'm wondering what the market will be like when I have 15 years experience? Do people really want engineers with 15-20 years of experience and more importantly will they pay top dollar for it?

Other than a 30 year career as engineer, the ""next step"" is becoming management but in my limited experience, it seems not worth it. For the the first rung of management, they get maybe a 10-15% pay bump over the senior engineers but work 10 more hours a week and have to answer emails late at night. Maybe the pay really starts climbing in the higher tiers, but there are few spots and it's highly competitive.

That being said it also seems to that as an individual contributor your salary peaks near the 10 year mark and then flattens for the remaininder of your career.

Basically it seems like staying as an individual contributor hits a ceiling relatively early but going up the ladder seems to have high costs?

Monitoring Land Subsidence using Extensometer (techincal qustions),"Hi I’m undergraduate mechanical engineering student, I’m currently working on a project about monitoring land subsidence.

as far as im concern there are 3 components that is essential in this method. its borehole, anchor and rod, my question is

1. is the anchor outside or inside the borehole? If it’s inside, how is the anchor placed/attached to the soil and take measurement, is the borehole has holes along its length or has a hole where the anchor supposed to placed?
2. if the anchor attached to the surrounding soil, and it moves vertically downward alongside with the soil, how could the head/borehole is not also moves downward? Because if it moves how is the measurement obtained, knowing that measurement is obtained between the anchor at the bottom and the reference point at head/collar of borehole? if the head/borehole also moves downward I think you can’t obtained the measurement, cause you need a steady structure as a reference point

"How to capture heat from sunlight into warm liquid ? (Black tubing vs black water) (if liquid, which liquid?)","I want to make a large, cheap, relient solar heat collector and I'm curious which approach is more efficient

Most DIY ers in this context will use black rubber hoses or thinner hoses painted black or copper tubing painted black.

I was wondering, if instead of presenting to the Sun a black opaque surface, then have a material(insulates)  between this surface and the water maybe it would be better to have light coming into the water and being absorbed directly ?

Light absorbed in water directly heats it instead of having to travel through another material. 

Also should light get to the bottom of the water and then end up being reflected, as it would come back out to the surface, the deeper it went to more chances it will still have to be absorbed.

What liquid can be used to capture solar heat this way ?

First that I thought is water plus a light fast black dye ? Or maybe water plus a suspension of carbon black powder (would it settle and require constant agitation?)

What about other light absorbant liquid, maybe oil with carbon black in it ?

How much better is this at collecting heat  than a black rubber hose ?


Also for various liquid choices, how deep do they have to be to capture most of the light with minimal reflection ?


For construction, I think a OSB box, 8 by 2 feet, interior sealed with caulking and painted with black paint (using a paint that will not outgas). 

One side of this box would be covered with 3mm thick glass. I would pull a light vacuum into the box for insulation.

Torn between different engineering majors,"Hi!

I'm currently in my last year of CEGEP. I live in Montréal (Québec), so this is equivalent to the last year of high school, but we are one year older. As a result, the engineering major will be 4 years instead of 5. I'm planning to go to the school Polytechnique Montréal. With research, I narrowed down my choices with 4 majors: mechanical, electrical, aerospace and software engineering. However, I am torn between them, each one seem to have advantages and disadvantages. Currently, neither stands out for me.  I know that some of them have a lot in common and that I could switch later, but I'm trying to avoid that.

Later as an engineer, I would like to work in an industry that helps the world in some way. I would love if my work had some kind of good impact on society, like working on green power, for example. Last semester, I also found that I love programming, I learnt the basics of Java and Python.

Here are my thoughts on each one of the majors:

&amp;#x200B;

**Mechanical Engineering**

Advantages: More general major (safe choice), more hands-on, power applications, mechanics is my favorite physics class currently

Disadvantages: Less programming

**Electrical Engineering**

Advantages: Energy industry, a bit more programming, electronics

Disadvantages: Apparently hardest major, I didn't enjoy electricity and magnetism physics class as much as mechanics

**Sofware Engineering**

Advantages: Programming, AI (I find it really cool, and Montréal is apparently very good for this industry), really bright future (high in demand, high pay)

Disadvantages: I don't know if I like programming enough for it to be my entire career, harder to switch major afterwards if I change idea

**Aerospace Engineering**

Advantages: Planes (okay), Space stuff (really really cool), very similar to ME

Disadvantages: I don't get why someone would choose this major instead of ME, since they are almost the same. Wouldn't someone benefit from having a more general major (and still work in aerospace)?

ME/EE/Haptics/Biomechatronics: Should I get a PhD?,"I'm a current senior (MechE but wish I would've done CompE/EE) who has applied to both PhD programs and industry jobs.  A lot of the industry jobs I'm looking at (mostly in health sensors, health data, haptics, wearables, or more generally embedding humans in technology) prefer a PhD, with a caveat being that while lots say PhD preferred, some also say ""or equivalent experience"" and some explicitly list that as ""a PhD or 5 years of experience in industry"".  Say 10-15 years in the future, will it really matter whether or not I have a PhD? I don't really want to be running experiments, and I certainly do not want to be a professor, but I don't want to hit a glass ceiling in the future.

At this point in time I don't really want to get a PhD because I don't want to be burned out for another 6 years, especially if the topic is in something I only halfway care about.  My approach would very much be ""only doing this to get a job"" but almost all the interviews / virtual days have stressed going into and staying in academia which I absolutely do not want to do.  The interviews have been mixed, some have gone well some have been kind of dull, and for the dull ones it's mainly because they ask me what my research passion is and I sort of flounder through that if they really push me for a research plan because like I said I'd be doing a PhD to get a job and not because I'm in love with some very niche section of their research.  I feel like I've sounded pretty biased so far but some of the work is pretty interesting, otherwise I wouldn't even be considering a PhD.  In group interviews I'll be with some kid who started research in high school and did it all 4 years of college and I'm not that person (literally all my experience is in robotics/data internships/jobs), so I guess it's just making me rethink whether this is really the path I want.  

A few schools I've interviewed at have been more industry focused, but I still feel like I'd be spending 6 years doing something say 60-70% aligned with what I actually am interested in (tbf I have broad interests so I wouldn't hate it probably) and making absolutely no money.  I feel like I don't really need a PhD as long as I could get my foot in the door somewhere, but I'm having trouble with the ""getting my foot in the door"" part.

Advice on applying to another lab without burning any bridges?,"Sorry if the topic isn't engineering-specific enough, but I was hoping to get a perspective from others navigating the STEM field on this.

I'm an ME student working as an undergrad research assistant for almost three months. The topics we research are a bit beyond the scope of where I think I want to go with my academic and professional career, but at the time I received the offer, their publications seemed fascinating and the position felt like the fabled foot in the door I've heard so much about.

Jump to today and my enthusiam for the subject has faded. Though I'm certain I can continue to produce good work at my current position for the remainder of the semester, I'm not sure my heart is in it.

Anyways, another position is recruiting, and I feel like their work is much closer to where I want to go with my degree. I am considering applying, but I wanted to get some input on my concerns.

First off, should I even try to switch positions? I feel like it would reflect poorly on me to try and change gears a couple of weeks into the semester. I don't know if trying to switch is going to rub either my current prof or the new one the wrong way.

If I should, how do I go about telling my current supervisor? I want to give them proper warning so they can prepare to reshuffle the workload distribution, but if I don't get the other position, then I will be seen as non-committed. I'm not concerned about losing my current position, but I am worried about losing the professor as a potential contact/recommender. My other option is to balance the two in something of a transition period before breaking off the old role.

Lastly, should I include the current position in my resume when applying? This goes back to the issue of whether including my current position is going to help or hurt my chances. The only similarity between the positions is the title, so I don't think including it will show any ""hard skills"", and I've done a couple extracurricular projects that would help me on the soft skill end.

Can I take a few years off of industry in a non-traditional job and return to industry after?,"Hello everyone! I am an engineering professor with a teaching focus. I recently got my master’s degree with a specialization in algorithm development. I had five internships prior to graduating, and I didn’t love the corporate industry environment. Once I graduated, I took a 1-year full-time engineering teaching position at a college and am really loving it. I am essentially my own boss, have so much flexibility with my time, get ~4 months off a year since I don’t do research, good retirement benefits (10.5% contribution from the college without any contribution from me), and enjoy coming to work each day. It would also be a perfect job for a mother if I wanted to start a family some day in regards to flexibility and hours worked. Cons are the pay (I make less than an entry-level bachelor’s salary right now), less interesting work intellectually (honestly I might get bored after a number of years), and the fact that there are such few jobs like this available. If I lost this job, it would be unlikely that I’d find another one like it. 

There has been discussion recently about turning this into a permanent, long-term role at my university. I’m so excited about the prospect of this, but I’m concerned that I would not be able to get back into the corporate engineering world if I ever needed or wanted to. As a 1-year role, it’s not too hard to jump into industry afterwards, but if I were to stay here for even another year or two I’m not sure I’d be able to get a role in corporate industry since I teach instead of doing technical work. Is this a valid concern? Is this valid enough to just leave this role at the end of my contract and go into industry now?

The engineers here know what a contour gauges it. I am trying to make a 3D contour gauge. Like the ones you are put your hand in face in that had all those pins. But I'm really trying to find the best way to do it, so that measure and putting the info into Fusion 360 isn't a 1000 hour job.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to model the exterior parts off my '21 Ducati Panigale V2. I have used a $600 3D scanner before and it sucks, it can't measure sharp curves correctly. The only other scanners out there are 6k, they would work for this purpose but I don't have that cash. So, that forces me to measure the parts manually. Body panels aren't something you can just take calipers to, the curves are hard to model.

&amp;#x200B;

Id also like this to be big enough that it can also be used for car parts... ideally but not necessarily.

&amp;#x200B;

So the problem I'm having, if I make a 3D contour gauge, and want a X,Y,Z coordinate every... 1/4"" inch or so (id really like it every mm but we have to compromise somewhere) then it would take a full shift of just inputting values in to different planes on fusion 360.

"B.Eng. in EE + Creative, Designing, Selling as Hobby = Job ?","Hey everyone, 

I‘ve just finished my B.Eng in EE a few weeks ago with very good grades and internships at prestigious Companies (Automotive since I’m an enthusiast). I’ve specialized in IT since that sounded most interesting to me and offered good outlooks. As resume -&gt; I don’t hate EE but I also don’t love it (more like a basic interest in some subjects). 

As a kid I always loved to build things with Lego or Bionicle. But what I always loved most about it was the process of designing / creating (bringing my ideas of a cool bionicle to reality). In school and in my free time I’ve also enjoyed drawing, especially anime characters since I really liked anime (Naruto and co.) This continued over the last years with several other things. Some examples: 

- Whenever I played games like mmorpgs, I always enjoyed creating a character among other things the most. Later I started flipping accounts (13y) and made good profits with that so I could reinvest in ingame money to reduce the boring grind. 
- At that time I’ve also started with photoshop and Sony Vegas to create some videos with effects of me playing (montages) and enjoyed that also. 
- When I grew up and started riding motorcycles with 16y, I immediately started working and maintaining them on my own. I flipped bikes every 1-2y since I wanted to try something new and actually made good money with it without focusing on making money. I don’t know why but I always had a good feel for the market and whenever it’s a good deal or not and also was quit good at selling. (Biggest profit was ~3k€ with 1 bike). And the funny thing is when I think back, I actually enjoyed the process of building my new bike like I imagined way before buying it mostly more then riding it and always wanted to improve something even tho I don’t really needed it. By now I’m also able to rebuild a whole engine and learned everything on my own. To sum things up: Bringing my Idea about a project to reality was always very enjoyable for me &amp; then selling the finished project to collect money for the next one.

"To anyone involved in geologic thin sectioning, is there a way I can get past manual grinding for electron microscopy?","Help for grinding thin sections for electron microscopy

Hey guys, I thought you would have some good advice on this,

I have recently undertaken some UG research that involves me polishing thin sections for electron microscopy. The current procedure requires that I start with a slide that has been polished with 600 grit silica slurry. 600 grit is acceptable for the optical microscope. 

The procedure for electron microscopy, involves the section being manually ground sequentially through a series of increasing grit sandpaper, from 600 to 800 to 1000 etc. , all the way to 2500 or so. At this point it can be put into the fine polishing machine which will get it smooth enough to be used. 

My issue with this stems from the fact I have a hand condition that causes me pain constantly, which is aggravated by physical exertion. It’s a chronic condition, and there are no signs of improvement. I’m really involved in this research and I want to make it work and make my profs proud, but I can’t physically take the hours of grinding.

I was wondering if you guys had any advice on what to do; I used to do a lot of machine work and diy before I developed my condition so I was wondering if. I could use something like a belt sander to cut out some of the stages, at least some of the rougher levels. It just needs to be smooth enough to put in the machine, and I’m ok with grinding the last stage or two manually, I think I can take that much.

"[D] When, if ever, does it make sense to store training data in a SQL database?","I’m trying to come up with some best practices when using PostgreSQL for the DS team. We’ve had a couple of projects using SQL DBs as training data sources for deep learning (DL) with upwards of 1TB of data. Note that in these projects, the training data very rarely changes or gets updated over the course of the project - for training, we typically isolate a large pool of data from any live applications. One major benefit over other storage approaches (e.g. file system) we’ve seen is the straightforward range query syntax for time series data, e.g.

    SELECT ts, col1, ..., colN
    FROM some_table
    WHERE ts &gt;= ? AND ts &lt;= ?

useful when sampling contiguous time series blocks of some variable length during batch generation. When working, e.g. with files, the same functionality can be tricky to implement if the data is not nicely structured. On the other hand, we did have a lot of issues when using the DB:

* Slow queries if the data is very large, even with the appropriate indices in place
* Zombie queries / processes on the DB (possibly caused by prematurely terminated training loops), eventually needing a DB restart
* A lot of time spent on ingesting the data, optimising the queries, data layout and DB maintenance

which leads me to believe that using the DB doesn’t really pay off, especially when the data is really large. It seems like even rolling a bespoke storage and query approach on top of a file system is better for performance and maintainability.

[P] Almost no one knows how easily you can optimize your AI models,"The situation is fairly simple. **Your model could run 10 times faster** by adding a few lines to your code, but you weren't aware of it. Let me expand on that.

1. AI applications are multiplying like mushrooms, which is awesome
2. As a result, more and more people are turning to the dark side, joining the AI world, as I did
3. The problem? Developers focus only on AI, cleaning up datasets and training their models. Almost no one has a background in hardware, compilers, computing, cloud, etc
4. The result? Developers spend a lot of hours improving the accuracy and performance of their software, and all their hard work risks being undone by the wrong choice of hardware-software coupling

This problem bothered me for a long time, so with a couple of buddies at Nebuly (all ex MIT, ETH and EPFL), we put a lot of energy into an **open-source library** called **nebullvm** to make DL compiler technology accessible to any developer, even for those who know nothing about hardware, as I did.

How does it work? It **speeds up your DL models by \~5-20x** by testing the best DL compilers out there and selecting the optimal one to best couple your AI model with your machine (GPU, CPU, etc.). All this in just a few lines of code.

The library is open source and you can find it here [https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm).

[D] Any tips to prepare for a ML system design interview?,"Do you guys have any tips to prepare for a system design (SD) interview focused on ML?

I have found some great SD interview mocks in YouTube, but they aren't ML oriented and the ones that are, focus on choosing the algorithm and not about building the system around it.

I am looking (not exclusively) for something like a set of standard questions that you could ask to the interviewer to help you choose things like the appropriate DB, how should you scale it, if you should split in microservices and which ones, etc.

For example, I think it would be good to start asking:

1. **Where is the data? Do we have access to it?** This would help to define if the data is in a DB that we can just query or if we need to enable an API for the users to upload data.
2. **Who is going to use the output and how?** This helps to define is the model is going to perform batch or stream predictions (i.e. if we need to focus on efficiency) and if the output needs to be stored somewhere for later access or if we should enable an API for its consumption.
3. **What kind of data do we have available?** This helps to define if we need a DB (for structured data), a blob storage (for unstructured data) if we need to design that part and if we can cache something if we need low latency.
4. **How many users/predictions should we serve?** This helps to define if we need something like microservices or if a monolithic approach should do.
5. **How much data do we have?** This helps to define what kind of DB to use and if we should shard (I'm not an expert on DBs, so that's the only way I know to scale).
6. **Do we have access to a training set?** This I think would come from the nature of the problem, but it's good to keep in mind.
7. **What are the best metrics to evaluate the model?** Idem.
8. **How important is explainability?** Idem. Also, this helps to decide/discuss the tradeoffs of black boxes and more traditional approaches.

[D] Biostat MS to CS PhD for Bayesian/DL/causal inf research,"So I recently got into a CS PhD with 0 background in CS and coming from biostat. In the future I would like to be an ML researcher doing research in the above fields. Surprisingly despite a biostat background, I got rejected from biostat programs likely due to lack of real analysis. However, my PI is actually also a statistician too. 

I want to go more into unstructured data, like images and probabilistic programming. I enjoyed my computational stat models+signal processing and PGM elective stat classes the most.

Anyways I am wondering how to smooth the transition to CS from Biostat. I know 0 general CS at all and the “lowest” level language I know is Python. Know R the best and Julia as well. 

One of the reasons I am pursuing a PhD is because I didn’t like the work as a Biostat-most of it wasn’t even actual stats and was regulatory writing related and simple hyp tests. 

So then I went to bioinfo-DS for a year and it is better, more stats, but it just ends up being the same formulaic on p&gt;&gt;n data of fit a model, extract p values and make plots and sometimes make a predictive model and report AUC on a sample
size of 100 as “proof of concept”. Not very rigorous and idk where its going. Seems like just pumping out some p values (aka fancy AB testing) and CSVs and pushing to a DB and I want something more. 

My goal with PhD is to go into ML research scientist, where I feel there is much more creativity and innovation with the stats. Is this a good enough reason? I don’t feel one can do RS without a PhD, and I don’t think im very into SWE stuff. 

For the actual AI classes I feel more prepared and they don’t look too bad, besides some change in terminology from stat to AI. I also do consider myself pretty good at numerical computing like translating eqns to code.  

But all the low level systems, programming languages, etc core courses I have 0 knowledge. Never done discrete math, pointers, formal algorithms, Java/C and all. I don’t know how to implement traversing a graph via A*/BFS/DFS or anything about proofs in Linear-Integer Programming Optimization. The required algorithms class involves this stuff. These “other” topics look much harder than stats/ML/AI and doesn’t have the typical math I am used to, whereas a lot of ML is “just” maximum likelihood and probability. 

I have until September to prepare. 

TLDR: How should a stat/biostat person who only knows numerical computing catch up in general CS for a CS PhD? Should I do discrete math and C++ MOOCs in the time in between?",MachineLearning,1645496281

So the task is to identify that the given image is a zoomed-up image of a trolley and the trolley should not have any hay or grass in it (altered requirements to avoid speaking on exact business logic for obvious reasons).  
In the second part, we tried to do it using Yolo v3 and we were getting good results/accuracy.  
But it also passes up those images that are not trolleys.  
It passes something which is just a zoomed-up image of the land or a house or a floor.

Can anyone point me to any of the good resources or tell me things that I can start my research from?

[P] Here's our new framework for Privacy Attacks in Federated Learning,"We recently uploaded our framework for privacy attacks in federated learning. You can find it here: [https://github.com/JonasGeiping/breaching](https://github.com/JonasGeiping/breaching). We include a sizable number of known attacks for deep neural networks in vision and text domains and some new ones.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these attacks are based on ""gradient inversion"". In federated learning, each user receives the state of a machine learning model from the server and then computes a local update (in the simplest case just the gradient of model parameters) based on their private data. This update is then aggregated with other users and sent back to the server.The key question for privacy for this protocol is whether it is possible to recover the original user data from their update. This turns out to be possible in several cases which can be simulated and attacked with this code framework.

&amp;#x200B;

We also include \[26 jupyter notebooks\]([https://github.com/JonasGeiping/breaching/tree/main/examples](https://github.com/JonasGeiping/breaching/tree/main/examples)) with examples and visualizations of these attacks. We hope this helps in replicating and extending some of the recent work in this topic. Let us know what you think!",MachineLearning,1645462795
"[D] When more past information is added to the NN, the prediction gets lazier?","Hi all,

I am currently trying to map the relationship between the input signal and the corresponding velocity of my system using a DNN with 3 layers with 64 neurons each.

Basically, the problem can be formulated as follow:

**Target Input:** Current system position, Last velocity values, Desired Velocity.

**Target Output**: Corresponding Input Signal

&amp;#x200B;

Below, you can see the reference velocity profile (purple) and the velocity profile produced with the predicted input signal (blue). The first image shows the result with 2 last velocity values and the below one without any history of the velocity values.

As one can see, the performance is better, when no past velocity values are provided to the DNN at all. I expected exactly the opposite. Also, I realize that the tracking is getting slower (see where the first peaks of the blue curves are). Is there a good reason for this?

My options all seem very bad:

1. Downloading from AWS (where the data is located) - very slow.
2. Paying for a persistent server. Something like a persistent AWS SageMaker notebook. This is very expensive. With even a mediocre GPU, it comes out to $2k/mo.
3. Uploading data to Google Drive and mounting Drive using below code. This is also surprisingly very slow. Took me an hour just to glob through which files were in google drive - let alone DL them.

&amp;#8203;

    from google.colab import drive  drive.mount('/content/drive')  

1. 4. Zipping up all the img files, uploading to Google Drive and then downloading as a single file to Colab, then unzipping. Ver tedious, but it seems DLing single file much faster.

What is the best solution here? I am ok with paying for a good option as long as its reasonable. Have any of the numerous MLOps startups developed a good solution to do massive data transfer to/from instances in Colab or otherwise?

This also required modification of the implementation of TiDB executor. Therefore, I didn’t talk about it in this article.

In the video, i displayed my journey like what made me to request my AI to help me this valentine and how we both managed to deal with the problem statement presented to us. It consists of my experiences while training a generative model using GPT and the results that we got were pretty amazing. Feel free to check out my experience using the given link. Hope we can relate with the experience of training a large model or else, if you are new in it, i hope it'll bring some value in your life.

**Love Quotes:**

* “The love of a woman in my heart is what keeps me strong when she is not around.”
* “Sometimes you just want to be loved and you just want to be loved and then you have to fight for your love.”
* “I do not know if i could be in love with someone as beautiful as you”
* “Love is the highest power in the universe”
* “I have had the pleasure of seeing you, and i am glad to have you back.”

**Sometimes, our AI turns out to be a great motivator:**

* “If you’re feeling hurt, give yourself time to heal.”
* “Do not let yourself be discouraged.”
* “I am the light of my life. i am the light that always shines brightly”
* “It is as simple as that : when you say you are sorry, no matter what your response is, you feel it. when you say you are happy, no matter what you say, you are living a beautiful life.”

**Sometimes, it turns out to be depressing:**

* “Love is like a dream. it is like a dream that can never be fulfilled.”
* “I love you so much i am afraid i will never see you again.”
* “Sometimes we get what we need. sometimes it comes too late. “

**Sometimes, it’s just eh idk:**

* “If you never really loved anyone, you were never likely to get along well. you were a pretty fucking pathetic little ass to me because you were the only one who really had the heart to live up to your own ridiculous expectations.”
* “i would rather die than live in a world where i am a prisoner of the law.”
* “I do not want to live in a society with someone who is not happy with the way i am”

[D] How to synthetically generate new 3-dimensional data from only 30 samples?,"Let me first preface by saying that I still consider myself new to machine learning and statistics.

I have 30 samples of a 3-dimensional time series data shown here https://imgur.com/a/dtihvbY that are very noisy. The first two dimensions look better when I select those that have the same characteristics https://imgur.com/a/kdTPjmq. My goal is to synthetically generate more samples such that the characteristics of the generated samples are decently similar to some of the original samples e.g., from the second image. I cannot use VAEs as I have too little data and was thus hoping the experts here could point me in the right direction.

Due to my limited knowledge, I have at the moment, several (really bad) solutions for generating new data and they are to fit a curve or smooth subsets of the data, to then fit a curve. E.g:
1. Randomly select points at every timestep from the second image then interpolate with a spline
2. or Exponential smoothing with various parameters and with randomly selected points at every timestep",MachineLearning,1645392219

[D] Do I need a “none of the above” option in multi label classification problem?,"I’m new(er) to classification and I’m trying to replace a model a colleague built that identifies 2 different classes with the potential of them both being present in the image. Currently they’re using softmax at the output and the options are item 1, item 2, both, or none, but I don’t think softmax should be used as it penalizes the model for identifying item 1 and 2 in the cases where both are present (I.e. classes are not mutually exclusive)

I was thinking of using 3 classes (item 1, item 2, or neither) with sigmoid at the output but Im starting to question whether I even need the “neither option”. I could just train to identify the 2 classes and add examples where neither are present. Then on model runtime I could just return neither if both class predictions return a probability less than 0.5. Thoughts?",MachineLearning,1645378953

[D] PhD thesis on an optimization problem that did not work.," 

Hey, I am seeking advice from people with some experience or insight into academia, otherwise it may be a bit boring :) The question is about discussing unsuccessful ML (sort of) project in a thesis. 

I started a PhD in biophysics 4.5 years ago. I learned to code and decided I want to make it into a career. I took a risk and for the final chapter of my thesis, I suggested to do an image processing project - regarding the analysis of complex microscopy data that no one has done before (or at least not published for sure). It was also useful to continue having some work to do during the lockdowns. My supervisor was kind of ""Sounds fun, do what you want"". Even though I learned a lot and the risk paid off in terms of career, as I already have a job offer as a mid-level software developer, I fear it puts me PhD at risk now.

Essentially through all my reading in the last few months I found out that this is mostly an optimization/minimization problem, where hundredths of signals have to be fit with a relatively complicated function to extract (guess/estimate) the biophysical parameters from each pixel. My knowledge is very high level (not in-depth), however.

**So far I have tried various pre-processing pipelines and various fitting methods - non-linear least squares (which has been postulated to do badly in these kind of problems), various minimization algorithms (both gradient descent and derivative-free), even maximum likelihood esitmation (postulated to do great in such problems, generally), different objective functions, etc, etc, and nothing works (it does converge, just most of the guesses are hitting the boundaries I have set, giving entirely meaningless outputs). Instead of a nice gradient descent, the cost function change throughout the function evaluations resembles some squares going up and down (excuse me for the simple speech).** I believe what I set out to do is achievable, but it would require an entire PhD and perhaps in-depth math knowledge, that I do not have and do not have time to learn.

Before the obvious ""talk to your supervisor"" - the supervisor has been useless throughout, regardless of how many times I try to ask him to put me in contact with someone who can help me, unfortunately he doesn't even understand what kind of help I need and keeps saying that ""it will be alright"" ... I have tried to get help from computer science friends, but there is so much domain knowledge behind it, that no one has been able to help me either. I don't want to go behind my supervisor's back to ask other professors for help, as for some reason he doesn't want this.

**With very short time left till the end of my PhD and no image yet to show, I decided to make it into a comparative / exploratory kind of study. In my field such papers come out quite often, comparing different algorithms to analyse different microscopy data (although they usually actually produce an image in the end). The story of the chapter would be ""We know this type of analysis is very challenging, but no one has attempted to explore the feasibility of various optimization algorithms so far, so this work will lay the foundatons of this type of analysis, hoping to encourage others to pursue it further"".**

Is such comparative analysis a ""thing"" in computer science literature and what is the best way to approach this (given the optimization didn't actually work)? If someone can just provide papers or publicly available thesises with similar work it would be amazing, or just some word of advice.

A paper by Beiranvand titled ""Best practices for comparing optimization algorithms "" (DOI 10.1007/s11081-017-9366-1) has been incredibly useful to get my head around how to think about this kind of work, but any further advice would be great.

*PS: I Already accept my responsibility for \*\*\*\*\*\* up my PhD with poor choices, I feel bad enough at the moment, so do not need anyone else to lecture me on things I should have done in the past. It is a life lesson I surely would never forget!*",MachineLearning,1645343703

[D] Optimization (minization) problem - hitting boundaries," I'm struggling with a challenging optimization problem with real-world experimental data. Simply put, it's about fitting a exponential decay model to a curve (decay). Essentially, I am trying to predict 3 parameters from the curve. The range of expected values for each parameter is well known, so I have set hard boundaries (also to avoid mathematical errors like divide by 0).

If you imagine I have a problem set of hundredths of decays, fitting all of them and making a histogram of each predicted parameter should give somewhat of a normal distribution (roughly) for each parameter. In reality, usually at least two of the parameters are predicted to be at the boundary in 90% of the cases. In reality, this parameter should be around 0.3 - 0.4. So my boundary range is already generous enough to allow for outliers. 

 

https://preview.redd.it/wtj54ugjuxi81.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bd0191919ec5dd316a3bb1675a03a263d12655a

This happens wth any method I try, whether non-linear least squares or some of the gradient or gradient-free minimizers. The number of boundary guesses does depend on the characteristics of the problem set (strength of signal etc), so I guess it is a matter of inability to do a proper fit (no one has done this before, so the problem really is challenging). However, nonetheless it converges successfully, leading to this distribution of values.

Can anyone help me out with an explanation why this is occurring, or the scientific terms for this so I know what to look for while trying to solve my problem?",MachineLearning,1645341230

[R] Can we modify WGAN with gradient penalty as a better form?,"I have encountered a rather interesting problem in my current work, and would like to come to the ground to ask your opinion.

The gradient penalty of WGAN is an interpolation between G(fake) and real, but my data is special in that fake is not noise, but it is a class of data with G(fake) (which can be interpreted as fake=G(fake)+noise). So my initial interpolation was done between fake and real, so I think since fake, G(fake) and real are a class of data, the area covered by the line between the interpolation should be larger than the area covered by the line between G(fake) and real. So our gradient penalty in this case can be done between fake and real.

I would like to ask if anyone has a similar idea as mine? If I plan to prove this, is there a mathematical method I can go to try to get started? thanks",MachineLearning,1645316261

[D] Stats textbook that traces every concept back to axioms?,"All ML/stats textbooks I've seen are variations of ""explain as well as possible without explaining everything"". They all leave significant gaps that inevitably require explaining down the line.

Take p-values in context of linear regression coefficients. When are they even valid or meaningful for assessing ""explanatory power"" of features? Most texts I've seen end at ""good if &lt;0.05"". But what's 0.05? De facto, it's the odds of observing a deviation from the regression line assuming *random normal distribution of errors,* which packs a bag of assumptions that's not always true.

The text shouldn't assume I know what ""random normal"" is either. Why e\^(-x\^2)? Trace it all the way back to elementary set theory and probability fundamentals. No memorizing.

Simply, I look for a source that either 1) explains everything, or 2) references other sources that do so. I realize 1) asks for a nonexistent master text that takes one from nothing to complete expertise, but 2) is entirely doable. If it's not been done before, I'm putting this out as a product idea I'd pay for much sooner than ""yet another clarity shot at stats"".",MachineLearning,1645298566

Looking  at the offers, it seems like companies ask for a typical DO stack and -  on top of that - things like technical knowledge of AI/ML, MLOps tools  like Kubeflow or Sagemaker, even some DE (Spark, Hadoop). That's a lot  and I'm wondering if it's even worth the effort to learn these things  given that:

\- there's not a lot of offers compared to general DO positions,

\- there's a lot of candidates trying to break into the field that could potentially (at least in theory) take these positions.

What's  your experience? Do you look for such people or do you expect your  MLEs/DEs to take care of that stuff? If the former, are there many  applicants just like in the case of DS and ML?",MachineLearning,1645290759

"[D] General electives in CS, specialized electives in CS, or additional math electives?","In total, I have room for about 5 electives before I graduate and I needed some advice as to what I should take them in. 

The first option would be to take more general CS electives, such as operating systems design, distributed systems, software engineering, database systems, internet technology, etc. I’m already a CS major so I’ll have taken all the basic stuff already. 

The second option is specialized CS electives. My CS department offers 6-7 4th year elective courses related to ML, including intro to data science, AI, ML, deep learning, computer-inspired programming (mostly on neural networks), computational robotics, etc. These really interest me but a lot of people are recommending that I self-learn these concepts. I think it’d be helpful to take at least 1 or 2 of these, especially since I wanna start research in a related topic soon. 

Last option is additional math electives. I say additional because I’m also a math major and have already taken real analysis, linear algebra, numerical analysis, PDEs, probability &amp; stat theory, and additional stats courses. Additional math courses would probably be linear optimization, graduate real analysis (includes measure theory), graduate numerical analysis, graph theory, stochastic calculus, etc.

Machine learning theory is a recent trend, intersecting pure math, computer science, and statistics.

[D] Which jobs should I consider given what I learned so far?,"**What I know**

I started learning python by late 2019 mostly through online courses, and later got interested in ML and took several courses including Andrew NG's machine learning and deep learning specialization. As of now I have several popular projects (700+ stars) on github and specifically ML projects in tensorflow. Most my personal projects were computer vision projects as I find working with images quite enjoyable. This does not necessarily mean I'm only seeking computer vision jobs, I'm just mentioning the facts, so, any ML/python related suggestions are welcome. I worked with numerous standard libraries: `pathlib`, `logging`, `os`, `shutil`, `sys`, `argparse`, ... as well as non-standard libraries: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `pytorch`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `opencv`, `openai gym`, `pytest`, `scrapy`, `requests`, ...  I also learned c++ and have basic familiarity with SQL (which is something I'm working on improving). 

**What I like**

I only like the coding and problem solving aspects, I like to design code, refactor/improve performance of existing solutions, automate the boring aspects of daily tasks, come up with new solutions to problems, debug, write test cases, have my code reviewed, and review others'.  Regarding ML, I like experimenting with different model architectures, find the best model to a given problem and end up with something useful.

**What I don't like**

I don't like theoretical shit, whatever I cannot apply in some code editing context, is of no interest to me. I'm not interested in statistics or mathematics. I can spend 12+ hours inside a code editor creating things, debugging, doing any related task and I'd absolutely do it every day over the long-term. On the other hand, I can't get myself to read math-heavy subjects for over 5 minutes and what usually happens is I start reading a paragraph and by the end of the first line of the paragraph which usually contains awkward mathematical notations (my eyes hurt already just picturing ), I start looking for distractions: I open youtube, reddit, ... and get back and read another line while I forgot about what was the first line about and so on. So, any job that will require this kind of effort on a daily-basis will not be a great idea.

&gt;How should a machine intelligence perform unsupervised structure discovery over streams of sensory input? One approach to this problem is to cast it as an apperception task. Here, the task is to construct an explicit interpretable theory that both explains the sensory sequence and also satisfies a set of unity conditions, designed to ensure that the constituents of the theory are connected in a relational structure.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, the original formulation of the apperception task had one fundamental limitation: it assumed the raw sensory input had already been parsed using a set of discrete categories, so that all the system had to do was receive this already-digested symbolic input, and make sense of it. But what if we don't have access to pre-parsed input? What if our sensory sequence is raw unprocessed information?  
&gt;  
&gt;The central contribution of this paper is a neuro-symbolic framework for distilling interpretable theories out of streams of raw, unprocessed sensory experience. First, we extend the definition of the apperception task to include ambiguous (but still symbolic) input: sequences of sets of disjunctions. Next, we use a neural network to map raw sensory input to disjunctive input. Our binary neural network is encoded as a logic program, so the weights of the network and the rules of the theory can be solved jointly as a single SAT problem. This way, we are able to jointly learn how to perceive (mapping raw sensory information to concepts) and apperceive (combining concepts into declarative rules).",MachineLearning,1645242549

[P] Computer Vision or AI/ML for assembly line defect detection?,"I  am looking into using either machine learning or computer vision to  perform quality control in an assembly line. Basically, I'd like to be  able to detect defects on our product without the need for human  intervention.

Here are a few facts about our assembly line:

1. We can present the product to an array of cameras in the same position and the same lighting conditions, every time.
2. We produce only one product, and it must be *exactly the same* every time
3. The  product is not mechanically complex, but does have some nooks and  crannies that may require multiple cameras and creative placement
4. We need to process each product in roughly 10 seconds

5)The product is roughly 2' x 6""

6)  The features we want to detect range from 1"" to 12"" in size. I.E. we  aren't looking to detect defects tiny defects on a large surface area.  Generally we are talking about making sure washers are present, bolts  are tightened (no gaps).

Given the  above requirements, I initially thought that using computer vision  (think opencv) to detect differences between a reference image and  images of assembled products would work. I still think that, although I  am worried about things like thresholds (of the diff) that might need to  be different depending on where the defect is. Also, I don't  immediately see an easy way of programmatically determining *which* component is missing/broken/defective. What I mean is, when a defect is detected, it would be nice to have feedback about *what*  specifically is wrong (""washer #3 missing"", ""Screw #6 not fully  tightened""). I don't have much experience with either CV or AI, so at  this point I'm just guessing, but I assume that AI would be a better fit  given my requirement for determining *what* exactly is wrong with the product.

Anyways,  I'm hoping some of you would give me your opinion on both approaches  and (for bonus points) point me to some resources that could get me  started. I have a pretty strong background in software development, but  again not much in CV and AI/ML.",MachineLearning,1645224851

Dataset for face detection via mask-r-cnn [Project]," 

Hello everyone,

For a project I am doing, I need a network that is able to retrieve human faces (just the face, none of the background) from images of scenes. For this task, I am currently using Mask-R-CNN and a tiny custom dataset I built using the VIA image annotation tool, wherein I've outlined human faces in about 100 images. This gets some okay results when used as fine-tuning on a pre-trained mrcnn model, but doesn't produce good enough results. I am wondering if anyone here knows of any good mrcnn-suitable (coco annotation style) datasets for face detection in scenes?

"[D] Improved VQGAN explained: MaskGIT: Masked Generative Image Transformer, a 5-minute paper summary by Casual GAN Papers","This is one of those papers with an idea that is so simple yet powerful that it really makes you wonder, how nobody has tried it yet! What I am talking about is of course changing the strange and completely unintuitive way that image transformers handle the token sequence to one that logically makes much more sense. First introduced in ViT, the left-to-right, line-by-line token processing and later generation in VQGAN (the second part of the training pipeline, the transformer prior that generates the latent code sequence from the codebook for the decoder to synthesize an image from) just worked and sort of became the norm.

The authors of MaskGIT say that generating two–dimentional images in this way makes little to no sense, and I could not agree more with them. What they propose instead is to start with a sequence of MASK tokens and process the entire sequence with a bidirectional transfer by iteratively predicting, which MASK tokens should be replaced with which latent vector from the pretrained codebook. The proposed approach greatly speeds-up inference and improves performance on various image editing tasks.

As for the details, let’s dive in, shall we?

So my question is how come that through SGD training NNs become more feasible than for SVMs? if this wasnt the case then SVMs should surely be used much more .

[N] Machine learning solutions for reducing exclusion of persons with hearing loss from cultural content (CFP),"Hearing loss is a common health problem in today’s societies. For example there are around 50 millions of “hard of hearing” people in the EU (around 9% of the total population). One of the biggest challenges of mild or severe hearing impaired listeners is being able to understand speech, music and generally sounds that are contained in cultural works such as theatrical plays, movies and concerts. This obvious difficulty increases the level of exclusion of people with hearing loss from such activities and therefore significantly influences their quality of life.   

Advances in the technology of hearing aids has only partly improved the ability of the people with mild hearing loss to participate in such cultural events, but it has not helped in severe hearing loss cases. At the same time, modern artificial intelligence applications have made it possible to automatically recognize auditory content and transcribe raw speech to text and present it to the users as enhanced subtitles in Augmented Reality (AR) systems or via haptic interfaces. In addition, deep-learning-based computer vision can help in improving communication of persons with hearing loss, through sign language recognition and facial expression analysis. These advances in automatic sound analysis, AR systems, computer vision, and haptic interfaces can lead to new applications that enable people with even complete hearing loss to follow a theatrical play, fully experience a museum tour or “feel” a live music performance. 

**This workshop invites contributions that focus on solutions that adopt: (a) modern audio/music/speech/image/video analysis methods and/or (b) innovative human-machine interaction pipelines, in order to boost the ability of the persons with hearing loss to follow theatrical plays, concerts, movies, museums, art exhibitions and any cultural content in general.**

# List of Topics

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* TV/Cinema live transcriptioning and subtitling methods and applications
* Music Perception Enhancement for Hearing Impaired Persons 
* Auditory scene analysis for hearing impaired applications
* Cochlear implant technology for music perception
* Live transcriptioning for improving human2human communication
* Speech emotion recognition
* Sign language translation
* Sign language synthesis
* Multimodal music experience
* Auditory scene visualization
* Visualization of prosodic aspects of speech, emotions and behaviors

# Goals

This workshop aims to attract an interdisciplinary group of researchers from fields such as auditory scene analysis, automatic speech recognition and speech analytics, affective computing, music perception, hearing aid technology, human-computer interaction and psychology, all focusing in finding solutions for making cultural content that contains sound as a basic medium, more easily accessible to people with hearing loss. As part of the larger theme of the PETRA conference, the participants will also have the opportunity to interact with top scientists working with pervasive assistive technologies to exchange valuable ideas that could advance the state-of-the-art in the field.

It optimizes the bias of the output neurons and then every connection it evolves decreases the fitness, so that it ends up with no connections at all. 

As fitness I use 1 - MSE-Loss. The network starts out with a fitness of a two-figure negative value and then quickly increases to about -1 after a a few hundred generations. Now, after a few thousand generations it is at about -0.2, but hasn't changed for the majority of it. Also, it never connects more than 2 - 3 of the inputs to the output. New connections and neurons quickly get deactivated. 

I am thankful for any advice or hint on how to improve the situation.

Thank you

Question on iteratively updating feature weights [P],"Hey all,

I currently have an NLP problem I am grappling with and could use input on. It's not a traditional machine learning problem per se, but it does involve optimization so I thought I could get help here. Essentially, I am have a dataframe with two columns: Features and Scores, where each feature represents a predetermined key phrase that I am matching in a given text string. What I am then doing is taking those key phrases, finding all occurrences in document, and then adding up the weights to get a total score for a given text.

The problem at hand is optimizing the weights, which are currently just a rough initialization. I was thinking of grid searching, but with 1000 features and weights I doubt that that's a good idea. Similarly, neural networks seem to be out given the nature of what I'm working with.

Thoughts and suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks!",MachineLearning,1645143025

[D] Paper Explained - CM3: A Causal Masked Multimodal Model of the Internet (Video Analysis and Author Interview),"[https://youtu.be/qNfCVGbvnJc](https://youtu.be/qNfCVGbvnJc)

This video contains a paper explanation and an incredibly informative interview with first author Armen Aghajanyan.

Autoregressive Transformers have come to dominate many fields in Machine Learning, from text generation to image creation and many more. However, there are two problems. First, the collected data is usually scraped from the web and uni- or bi-modal and throws away a lot of structure of the original websites, and second, language modelling losses are uni-directional. CM3 addresses both problems: It directly operates on HTML and includes text, hyperlinks, and even images (via VQGAN tokenization) and can therefore be used in plenty of ways: Text generation, captioning, image creation, entity linking, and much more. It also introduces a new training strategy called Causally Masked Language Modelling, which brings a level of bi-directionality into autoregressive language modelling. In the interview after the paper explanation, Armen and I go deep into the how and why of these giant models, we go over the stunning results and we make sense of what they mean for the future of universal models.

"[D] Is the competition/cooperation between symbolic AI and statistical AI (ML) about historical approach to research / engineering, or is it more fundamentally about what intelligent agents ""are""?","I  have found that comprehensive overviews of artificial intelligence  (Wikipedia, SEP article, Norvig and Russel's AI: A Modern Approach) make  reference to symbolic AI and statistical AI in their historical context  of the former preceding the latter, their corresponding limitations  etc. But I have found it really difficult to dissect this from the  question of whether the divide / cooperation between these paradigms are  about the implementation of engineering of intelligent agents, or if  they are getting at something more fundamental about the *space of possible minds*  (I use this term to be as broad as possible considering anything we  would label as a mind, regardless of ontogeny, architecture, physical  components etc)?

I have given a  list of questions below, but some of them are mutually exclusive, i.e.  some answers to one question make other questions irrelevant. The fact  that I have a list of questions is a demonstration of the fact I find it  difficult to find what the boundaries of the discussion are supposed to  be. Basically, I haven't been able to find anything that begins to  answer the title question. And so I wouldn't expect any comment to  answer each of my subquestions one by one, but to treat them as an  expression of my confusion to maybe try an point me in some good  directions. Immense thanks in advance, this has been one of those  questions strangling me for a while now.

* While  trying to concern oneself as little as possible with the implementation  or engineering of minds, what is the relationship between symbolic AI,  connectionism, and the design space of minds?  

   * When  we talk about approaches to AI “failing”, is this in terms of  practicality / our own limitations? I.e. without GPUs, in some sense  “deep learning fails”. And by analogy, symbolic AI’s “failure” isn’t  indicative of the actual structure of the space of possible minds.
   * Or  is it more meaningful. I.e. the “failure of symbolic AI in favor of  statistical methods” is because ‘symbolic AI’ simply doesn’t map onto  the design space of minds.

1. Are  symbolic AI and machine learning merely approaches to design an  intelligent system? I.e. there are regions in the design space of minds  that are identifiable as ‘symbolic’ and others as ‘connectionist/ML’.
2. Do  all minds need symbolic components and connectionist components? And if  so, what about the human brain? The neural network / artificial neural  network comparison is largely analogous rather than rigorous - so does  the human brain have symbolic &amp; connectionist modules.
3. Regardless  of research direction / engineering application, what is the state /  shape / axis of the design space of minds? Does symbolic AI talk about  the whole space, or just some part of it? And what about connectionism?
4. If it is the case that symbolic AI does talk about architecture, then  

   1. If  symbolic and connectionist are completely separable (i.e. some regions  in the design space of minds are entirely one or the other), then what  could some of the other regions be?
   2. If  symbolic and connectionist aren’t completely separable (i.e. all minds  have some connectionist components and some symbolic components), then  are there other necessary components? Or would another category of  module architectures be an addition on top of the ‘core’ symbolic +  connectionist modules that not every mind in the design space of minds  needs?
5. Is  ‘symbolic AI’ merely not interested in design and it serves more to  explain high level abstractions? I.e. symbolic AI describes what/how any  mind in the design space of minds is thinking not what the architecture  of some particular mind is?  

   1. As  an extension, if this is the case, is symbolic AI a level above  architecture and therefore there could be isomorphism between two  different mind architectures, but “think in the same way” - therefore  are the same mind, merely different implementations.  

      1. In  one abstract layer above the way some people consider it irrelevant  whether a human mind is running on a physical brain, a computer  simulating the physics/chemistry of a human brain, or a computer running  the neural networks embodied in a brain.",MachineLearning,1645138616

Obviously I can simply build a head that has outputs of class scores for the classification and an ouput for the regression value. However, the labels are coupled in the sense that the class None implies an intensity of zero in the regression output and vice versa. I think modelling this coupling may improve the accuracy and prevent contradicting outputs.

"[D] What are the standard ways to visualise, clean and manage the large image datasets?","

Hi everyone, I'm working on a computer vision problem that need large dataset, I scrapped multiple images of different categories and it's attributes/metadata like image name, url etc. from different websites.


While scrapping the data, I wrote the scrapping scripts for different websites and saved the data from individual websites with the textual attributes/metadata of the images saved in the CSV file.


Now, since I completed the scrapping from different websites, I want to merge all the downloaded images and its metadata in a central location for further preprocessing and cleaning.


I'm wondering what are the de facto standard of managing large image dataset (&gt;100K images) such that I can clean the data manually or programmatically while also keeping track of the previous states? 


When I say clean the data, this means dividing the images in different categories, removing the invalid images, performing transformations on the images etc. while doing all this, we also have to maintain the attributes/metadata of the images such that we can keep track of all this and at the same time the data is presentable and viewable through web or something to technical and non-technical stack holders so that they can keep a note of what's happening with the data.


One thing I can think of is creating relational database, then ingest all the data from the CSV to that database, while maintaining some kind of flags to keep track of the valid or invalid images and its categories based on the data preprocessing steps. But I've no clue about how to make the data accessible/viewable to non-technical stackholders! I think there must be some better approach for this case!


I'd really appreciate if you could share your experiences and expertise in dealing with such situations.


Thank you so much.",MachineLearning,1645084341

[Discussion] Fragility of AlphaZero vs Stockfish in chess-Domain adaptation.,"In terms of transfer learning/domain adaptation for these models I was wondering how you think minor changes to the game might affect the performance?

Stockfish is a simulation based engine, while AlphaZero is the reinforcement learning engine. In a trained state, AlphaZero completely dominates Stockfish.

Assuming both are trained on a regular chess set, suppose you change the starting squares of bishops and knights, would this completely mess up AlphaZero?

I don't see it causing a huge problem for Stockfish due to the similarity in piece movements and method in evaluating a position. 

For AlphaZero, switching bishops and knights is not a possible starting position. It is close to a real position, and likely after a couple of moves it becomes a viable position.

I understand if you train it on chess and apply it to checkers, it won't perform. But this is still ""chess"".

"[D] AI against Censorship: Genetic Algorithms, The Geneva Project, ML in Security, and more! (Video Interview)","[https://youtu.be/zcGOPqFZ4Tk](https://youtu.be/zcGOPqFZ4Tk)

Most of us conceive the internet as a free and open space where we are able to send traffic between any two nodes, but for large parts of the world this is not the case. Entire nations have large machinery in place to survey all internet traffic and automated procedures to block any undesirable connections. Evading such censorship has been largely a cat-and-mouse game between security researchers and government actors. A new system, called Geneva, uses a Genetic Algorithm in combination with Evolutionary Search in order to dynamically evade such censorship and adjust itself in real-time to any potential response by its adversaries. In this video, I talk to Security researcher Kevin Bock, who is one of Geneva's main contributors and member of the Breakerspace project. We talk about the evolution of internet censorship, how to evade it, how to mess with the censors' infrastructure, as well as the broader emerging connections between AI and Security.

Big companies like Google/FB have the resources to manually label datasets for a specific domain and hence train a model to be very good at that specific domain. On the flip side, when using a multi-target domain adaptation method, you get a more generalised model, however, the performance on that specific domain may suffer. If the companies' primary goal is to maximise performance, is there much of a benefit of having a generalised model over a specialised one?

[R] Introducing the ICBe Dataset: Very High Recall and Precision Event Extraction from Narratives about International Crises,"Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07081

Abstract: ""How do international crises unfold? We conceive of international affairs as a strategic chess game between adversaries, necessitating a systematic way to measure pieces, moves, and gambits accurately and consistently over different contexts and periods. We develop such a measurement strategy with an ontology of crisis actions and interactions and apply it to a high-quality corpus of crisis narratives recorded by the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) Project. We demonstrate that the ontology has high coverage over most of the thoughts, speech, and actions contained in these narratives and produces high inter-coder agreement when applied by human coders. We introduce a new crisis event dataset ICB Events (ICBe). We find that ICBe captures the process of a crisis with greater accuracy and granularity than other well-regarded events or crisis datasets. We make the data, replication material, and additional visualizations available at a companion website (http://www.crisisevents.org/).""

Moving beyond engagement: How could Facebook's algorithms optimize for human values instead? [D],"I used to work at Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. One of the big questions I focused on: what was the right objective function to align our AI systems towards?

When we started optimizing for watch time at YouTube, for example, our algorithms started suggesting longer videos for the sake of longer videos, and videos with racy thumbnails.

Similarly, optimizing for engagement at Facebook led to low-quality clickbait, and Hooter's appearing as the top search result when you searched for restaurants in Houston.

Experiments that increased favorites and replies at Twitter invariably increased toxic content as well.

So while watch time, engagement, and replies would always go up -- were these really the products we wanted to build? What happened to Facebook's original mission of connecting users with their friends and family? What did ""favorites"" have to do with being the platform for public conversation at Twitter? A lot of work at these companies is spent measuring active users, but where were the dashboards measuring progress to these broader goals? It's easy to become blinded by standard metrics and lose sight of the original product principles that made us stand out.

So could we figure out a metric that was better tuned to human values and the product mission we cared about, but also fast, rigorous, and easily measurable? After all, we still need our A/B tests, ML objective functions, and OKRs.

[D] Finding valid generalizations about deep learning models," 

Hello everyone,

I  have a weird question to ask. I have a simple CNN model that takes in  6000 dimensional input and maps it to one of the 10 classes. My aim is  to find a way to reduce the accuracy of my trained model as much as I  can while introducing minimum amount of noise to the input.

I'm  obviously using adversarial AI methods. It seems like finding the  gradients of class outputs with respect to input instead of the weights  is giving me the best results. I update the inputs that belong to a  certain class with these gradients that I calculated for every output,  and I analyze at what point does my model start classifying input that  belong to class A, as class B. For every class, I essentially take  inputs that belong to that class, update it with gradients of every  other class and see which output class takes the least amount for my  model to be classifying the inputs as.

Well,  this works. I can see my inputs slowly start to get classified as some  other class. So this means I have a vague understanding of what class is  closest to what other class in input space.

Now  comes the problem. For every class, I want to create a single gradient  that I can apply to all inputs that belong to that class to make my  model classify those updated inputs as something else. This means I have  to find a way to generalize all these different gradients that I've  calculated.

How the hell do I do  that? Just taking the average of every gradient I calculated gives me a  good estimate. But I end up applying that calculated single gradient to  every input that belongs to one class. And if I decide to train a new  model using the dataset that has noise added, the new trained model  gives me even higher accuracy. Sure, I end up lowering the accuracy of  my main model, but anyone can just simply train a new model with dataset  that has the noise added and classify the inputs with even better  accuracies.",MachineLearning,1644951686
[D] Macbook or HP Omen 30L,"I'm looking to upgrade my computer for my business. Right now I have an early 2015 Macbook Air but have mostly been doing my machine learning on a 2019 Macbook Pro along with Azure. I'm done paying for Azure and can't use the Macbook Pro for the project I'm about to embark on because of conflicts with projects. Therefore, I need a new computer for myself. I'm considering an HP Omen 30L with either the RTX 3060ti or the RTX 3080 but am a HUGE mac fan for the interface. Therefore I've also considered buying the tower and interfacing in through my macbook (this one or a new one in a few months). However, I also need portability. The main push for me to get the HP is (a) to occasionally play games with my son...though I can do that also through a console and (b) for when I do large datasets/neural nets. 

Would my money be better spent on a new Macbook with the M1 chip? Or on the HP Omen? In the end I'd be spending around the same amount.",MachineLearning,1644951666

[D] Should We Be Using JAX in 2022?," JAX is an *extremely* cool Google project that's now a few years old - is it time to start migrating to JAX?

JAX can be incredibly fast and, while it's a no-brainer for certain things, Machine Learning, and especially Deep Learning, benefit from specialized tools that JAX currently does not replace (and does not seek to replace).

**I wrote** [an article](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/why-you-should-or-shouldnt-be-using-jax-in-2022/) **detailing why I think you should (or shouldn't) be using JAX in 2022**. It also includes an overview of the big JAX transformations, as well as some benchmarks like this:

**What do you think about JAX in 2022? Some points of discussion that you might want to touch on:**

* Will JAX's functional paradigm lead to issues for those without functional experience, especially in Deep Learning?
* What's your favorite Deep Learning API for JAX - [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax), [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku), [Elegy](https://github.com/poets-ai/elegy), something else?
* Are there cases or fields in which you think JAX should **definitely** or **definitely not** be used?
* Do you think JAX (plus higher-level tools) could replace TensorFlow eventually, or do you think JAX is intended in part as Google's answer to PyTorch [dominating the research landscape](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-in-2022/#research-papers), or are both of these hypotheticals/theories wrong?
* Where do you see JAX fitting in generally in the Machine Learning world going forward, and especially as an alternative to PyTorch in particular?
* Do you think higher-order optimization being easier with JAX will be important in the coming years?

[D] What are Banks really doing with AI? Wells Fargo shares their thoughts,"Hey r/MachineLearning

I wanted to share this upcoming event with **Agus Sudjianto, Executive Vice President, Head of Corporate Model Risk at Wells Fargo**. I'm interested to learn how Wells Fargo is using AI and their specific use cases - thoughts? Below is the description from the website:

\---------

The banking industry has rapidly adopted Machine Learning for various  applications for predictive analytics and process automation. The  adoption of AI/ML is very natural because of the nature of the business  that is both data and process intensive. While the benefits of AI/ML are  very compelling, they are also bringing new risks beyond the  traditional financial risk. With their model risk management practice  that has been maturing in the last 10 years, banks are ahead of other  industries in managing the risk of AI/ML. One of the key aspects to  manage the risk is model explainability. 

While the adoption of so called  ExplainableAI, which is typically ‘black box’ machine learning models  accompanied by post-hoc explainability tools, is becoming more common  for low risk applications, the concern remains for high risk areas such  as credit underwriting; thus large banks are typically more cautious in  adopting the methodology. There are many recent developments on  inherently interpretable, self-explanatory machine learning models  without the problem of post-hoc explainers. The focus of my talk will  cover applications of AI/ML, their risk management as well as the  approach for designing inherently interpretable machine learning for  high-risk applications.

[D] Legality of Commercial Use of Public Video Data?,"There's been a buzz in the policy space about how people's personal data can be used, to an extent that's pretty surprising. For example, Meta is currently being sued by the state of Texas (and settled with Illinois for $650 million dollars) for using user's pictures for training facial recognition algorithms. Anecdotally I've heard large companies have issues with models trained on ImageNet given that the license for each image varies and models could be considered derivative works. 

Specifically, I'm concerned about MOT style tracking datasets. While MOT16/17/20 are covered by Creative Commons and explicitly can't be used for commercial purposes, based on some quick Googling it seems like making and labelling your own recordings of public spaces to train commercial detectors [might be illegal as well](https://www.business2community.com/video-marketing/recording-people-public-private-places-legal-ramifications-01238806); i.e. you need permission of the video's participants to commercialize work containing them.

[D] Problems with interpretability research + blog post about recent NeurIPS paper,"I recently read a NeurIPS paper arguing that neural networks find class information in patterns that are nonsensical to humans. I don't agree with the perspective that the authors present in the paper, and I wrote a blog post about it.

Here's a link: [https://sprin.xyz/articles/overinterpretation.html](https://sprin.xyz/articles/overinterpretation.html)

The authors of the NeurIPS paper find tiny nonsensical ""sufficient input subsets"" of images, meaning that when they remove all but 5% of the pixels in an ImageNet image, the classifiers will still predict the original class with high confidence (see Figure 1 in my blog). They claim that within those remaining 5% of pixels, there is sufficient evidence for the classifier to base its prediction. In my article I argue that this is not true. Rather, by following their algorithm to remove pixels, you introduce what are essentially adversarial patterns in the image.

I think this highlights a hard-to-solve problem with a lot of interpretability research: when you run an algorithm to interpret a deep learning model, it's really hard to tell if you are actually learning about the deep learning model or if what you see is a result of an artifact of the interpretability algorithm itself.

[D] Alternatives to clustering to represent hand shapes,"I am looking into representations of body part shapes, in particular a representation of the hand shape.

A first step is pose estimation, giving typically 63 values (21 3D joint coordinates). What I want is a representation derived from that, that models the shape of the hands.
Preferably I would avoid having to collect tons of data, something that can be derived from those joint coordinates would be perfect. Something like the amount of bending in every finger, but less rule based.

I've encountered interesting models like MANO (based on SMPL) and STAR, but I don't think they fit my use case.

Of course, a possibility would be to perform clustering of a collection of pose data and looking at the cluster centroids to see if they map to any discernible hand shapes. Alternatively, I could look at PCA of the coordinates.

[D] Setting up a server for ML/DL research for small group?,"I currently have a server with one Tesla V100S which I would like to use for ML/DL research for a group of researchers and students (no more than 12 people). My experience so far has been limited to local development in my own (Windows) machine. Data in filesystem and that kind of thing, so I'm punching a bit above my weight here. My background is more from the maths side than the CS side, so I've never had to deal with much stuff from below the level of my local python installation (colleagues have roughly the same backgrounds). That being said, I apologize if these are irritatingly simple matters.

I'd like for this server to be able to be used for a variety of ML/DL tasks. Not just training models but also having the capability for whatever data visualization/analysis/processing tasks couldn't be done locally for whatever reason. While it has a comfortable amount of hard drive space, we also have a NAS we would like to be able to be used seamlessly for storing data. Finally, at some point we'd probably like to host some (local) VMs/containers for running periodical scraping jobs, software license servers, local web applications, or web interfaces for organizing/browsing the datasets stored in the server/NAS. Also a public website for the group, if we manage to get through the bureaucracy of getting a public-facing tunnel from our institution. 

The server currently has no OS, and I'm facing the first question of which one to install. I'm being given the option of Windows Server, vSphere or my favorite linux flavor. I'm assuming windows is the suboptimal option here, and while I like some vSphere features, I'm not super stoked about the closed software, smaller community and licensing fees. I'm guessing linux is the better option here?

Following this, I'm wondering how to access and manage the server resources from client machines. I don't know what options exist out there beyond everyone having to ssh into the server from local machines, copying scripts and downloading results back to the local machines. Is it possible to split GPU among various tasks use like other resources like RAM/CPU?",MachineLearning,1644856915

**EvoRL 2022**  
**Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning workshop at GECCO 2022, July 9-13, Boston, USA**

===============

In recent years reinforcement learning (RL) has received a lot of attention thanks to its performance and ability to address complex tasks. At the same time, multiple recent papers, notably work from OpenAI, have shown that evolution strategies (ES) can be competitive with standard RL algorithms on some problems while being simpler and more scalable. Similar results were obtained by researchers from Uber, this time using a gradient-free genetic algorithm (GA) to train deep neural networks on complex control tasks. Moreover, recent research in the field of evolutionary algorithms (EA) has led to the development of algorithms like Novelty Search and Quality Diversity, capable of efficiently addressing complex exploration problems and finding a wealth of different policies while improving the external reward (QD) or without relying on any reward at all (NS). All these results and developments have sparked a strong renewed interest in such population-based computational approaches.  
Nevertheless, even if EAs can perform well on hard exploration problems they still suffer from low sample efficiency. This limitation is less present in RL methods, notably because of sample reuse, while on the contrary they struggle with hard exploration settings. The complementary characteristics of RL algorithms and EAs have pushed researchers to explore new approaches merging the two in order to harness their respective strengths while avoiding their shortcomings.  
Some recent papers already demonstrate that the interaction between these two fields can lead to very promising results. We believe that this is a nascent field where new methods can be developed to address problems like sparse and deceptive rewards, open-ended learning, and sample efficiency, while expanding the range of applicability of such approaches.  
With the Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning Workshop, we want to highlight this new field currently developing while proposing an outlet for the two communities (RL and EA) to present new applications and ideas and discuss past and new challenges.

[R] ChemicalX: A Deep Learning Library for Drug Pair Scoring,"In this paper, we introduce ChemicalX, a PyTorch-based deep learning library designed for providing a range of state of the art models to solve the drug pair scoring task. The primary objective of the library is to make deep drug pair scoring models accessible to machine learning researchers and practitioners in a streamlined framework.The design of ChemicalX reuses existing high level model training utilities, geometric deep learning, and deep chemistry layers from the PyTorch ecosystem. Our system provides neural network layers, custom pair scoring architectures, data loaders, and batch iterators for end users. We showcase these features with example code snippets and case studies to highlight the characteristics of ChemicalX. A range of experiments on real world drug-drug interaction, polypharmacy side effect, and combination synergy prediction tasks demonstrate that the models available in ChemicalX are effective at solving the pair scoring task. Finally, we show that ChemicalX could be used to train and score machine learning models on large drug pair datasets with hundreds of thousands of compounds on commodity hardware.

[D] Bayesian Optimization for Noisy Functions,"I have always been interested in learning about how noisy functions are optimized and the challenges/obstacles that can occur in the process.

For instance - in many real world applications (e.g. machine learning), we construct the objective function we are trying to optimize from a discrete set of measurements, and these measurements usually have some noise and random component. For instance, if we were to collect the same measurements at a different time, its very likely that the measurements might have some variation - and thus the objective function would be slightly different: this is what is referred to as a ""noisy function"".

I have heard that Bayesian Optimization methods are able to partially remedy this problem by using a Gaussian Process to ""smoothen out"" regions around these discrete measurements based on how much information and confidence we have around these measurements, thus creating a ""surrogate response surface"" that is being optimized instead of the original function. Somehow, this ""surrogate"" is supposed to ""partially remedy"" the optimization of noisy functions - however, I am not entirely sure about this.

Can someone please provide some further comments on Bayesian Optimization for Noisy Functions?

"[P] 20K+ Arxiv ML Papers Vectorised, Cluster Application and Projector","In recent years, the number of research papers have grown tremendously. New areas are popping up everyday but it is not exactly clear which areas are emerging or which interesting new area has just surfaced up. As a result, I decided to cluster together 20k+ interesting machine learning papers that were recently surfaced up (scraped sometime in November-December in 2020).

[Cluster Application](https://cloud.relevance.ai/dataset/research2vec/deploy/cluster/jacky-wong/M0FQOVdINEJZQTVzdWJmNHdQaXI6M1NIMVFncm9TNENZeU1vNUNHTUVWZw/60_dWH4Bq8SHcPzXrEpF/old-australia-east/)

**Method**

I created the vectors using a fine-tuned version of Sentence Transformer's roberta-base  
 model. 

*Dataset Curation*

The dataset curation process was fairly straightforward. I used the arxiv Python API and scraped 20k papers off the query ""machine learning"" sometime in late 2020 before I began experimenting. 

I am looking to get feedback on what others might like to see in this application and would be curious to hear suggestions on where I could improve. 

*Model Training*

In order to get some form of off-the-shelf domain adaptation, I used off-the-shelf BART for unsupervised query generation and then fine-tuned my roberta embeddings using multiple negative rankings loss based on SentenceTransformers. I then trained my model on the title and abstract of the research papers so that the model could better understand some of the data. 

*Clustering*

Afterwards, I encoded the titles and clustered them using a simple Mini-Batch K Means algorithm. This seemed to work quite well as the topics seemed to have separated out quite nicely in my embeddings projector. The clustering approach was evaluated a few different times empirically for when clusters were too small and clusters were too big.

*Labelling*

**Curating the dataset**

&amp;#x200B;

From previous research, I did find this repository along with its relevant Reddit posts:

However, as the dataset was different, I was unable to use the exact method provided.

[P] Discover the geographical position of weather historical data using weather historical predictions," 

I have too little experience in neural networks and I wanted to solve a problem that I don't know how to raise.

On the one side, I have a 1 year hourly historical data of the temperature in a specific location. (Output of the neural network)

On the other side, I have a 1 year hourly historical data of the temperature predictions around the earth (having for each hour a matrix 3072 x 1536 representing temperature values in specific latitudes and longitudes of the earth).

For you to have a better idea, for each hour I have the following data:

https://preview.redd.it/89qdpgj4qmh81.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87bf7aba7c268c2a2bda697923af4e66a463d1a8

But not only for Spain but for the whole earth, What I want to do is input this data into the neural network using the temperature of a specific location as an output.

After that, use one of the inputs and modify a bit the value of each of the points in an isolated way (only one modification each time).

The modification of the input that has made a greater modification of the output will be the specific location of the temperature data.

I have several questions, I don't know if neural networks are the best tool to do this. If they are, How do I have to set up the model?, I use a convolutional network? Do I have to apply some filters before inputting the temperature data to the network?

[P] C++ Machine Learning Library Built From Scratch by a 16-Year-Old High Schooler,"Hello r/MachineLearning!

In this post, I will be explaining why I decided to create a machine learning library in C++ from scratch.

If you are interested in taking a closer look at it, the GitHub repository is available here: [https://github.com/novak-99/MLPP](https://github.com/novak-99/MLPP). To give some background, the library is over 13.0K lines of code and incorporates topics from statistics, linear algebra, numerical analysis, and of course, machine learning and deep learning. I have started working on the library since I was 15.

Quite honestly, the main reason why I started this work is simply because C++ is my language of choice. The language is efficient and is good for fast execution. When I began looking over the implementations of various machine learning algorithms, I noticed that most, if not all of the implementations, were in Python, MatLab, R, or Octave. My understanding is that the main reason for C++’s lack of usage in the ML sphere is due to the lack of user support and the complex syntax of C++. There are thousands of libraries and packages in Python for mathematics, linear algebra, machine learning and deep learning, while C++ does not have this kind of user support. You could count the most robust libraries for machine learning in C++ on your fingers.

There is one more reason why I started developing this library. I’ve noticed that because ML algorithms can be implemented so easily, some engineers often glance over or ignore the implementational and mathematical details behind them. This can lead to problems along the way because specializing ML algorithms for a particular use case is impossible without knowing its mathematical details. As a result, along with the library, I plan on releasing comprehensive documentation which will explain all of the mathematical background behind each machine learning algorithm in the library and am hoping other engineers will find this helpful. It will cover everything from statistics, to linear regression, to the Jacobian and backpropagation. The following is an excerpt from the statistics section:

[D][P] how to collect a computer vision dataset?,"Context: my team is researching some plant-growth patterns using object detection models. We have collected a small set of images (a few thousand) and ran some simple experiments. The results were encouraging, so now we want to do some serious data collection (tens of thousands of images), but before doing so, we would like to have (create?) some ""collection protocol"", such as: defining the resolution of the images, times of day, weather, etc.

For example, since our application will only run during daylight, we won't collect nighttime images. And since we cannot control the weather, we want to ensure that we have training data with different conditions, such as rain, fog, etc.

Although (we think) our ""collection protocol"" is reasonable, it is still an ad-hoc product. We would feel better about doing such extensive data collection if we had some sort of ""formal guideline"", you know? I have read multiple papers discussing how datasets are made, but they usually focus on ""how the data was labeled"" and not on ""how the data was collected"".

Can you guys suggest some peer-reviewed papers that discuss the data collection process itself? We hope to avoid non-obvious pitfalls that we have not considered.

[D] Can we solve this problem with graph neural network (GNN)," 

Here is the formulation of the problem: Let G = &lt;V,E&gt; be an undirected graph with nodes V and edges E.

The nodes can be of 2 types: **red** or **green.**

A green node can be linked to **several** red nodes but **never** to another green node.

A red node can be linked to **several** green nodes but **never** to another red node.

Here is what a graph of this type looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

[Graph described above. Each green node has a probability of belonging to a neighboring red node.](https://preview.redd.it/fhadks27ldh81.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10e45e3187fd499450eba968802991aa170c522e)

For each edge of the graph I would like to estimate a probability.

This probability represents the probability of attribution of a green node to a red node. For each green node the sum of its edges is 1.

My question is this: Is there a way using a GNN and a softmax function to infer this kind of probability?

I was pointed to the repositories on Gitlab, told which tools the team used (docker, jupyter, etc), manually given access to datasets that I mounted on my machine, and was left to set things up myself.

All in all, it took me about a week to get everything set up and ready to contribute, with ongoing issues over the next few weeks due to poor documentation in the setup phase.

One of my issues is that model development is a bit tricky to develop locally and test on SLURM because there are always issues moving from CPU to GPU, and SLURM jobs don't run instantaneously. We also don't use any formal framework like Kubeflow or Weights and Biases experiment tracking.

"[D] FOMM Paper digest: First Order Motion Model for Image Animation explained, a 5-minute paper summary by Casual GAN Papers","If you have ever used a face animation app, you have probably interacted with First Order Motion Model. Perhaps the reason that this method became ubiquitous is due to its ability to animate arbitrary objects. Aliaksandr Siarohin and the team from DISI, University of Trento, and Snap leverage a self-supervised approach to learn a specialized keypoint detector for a class of similar objects from a set of videos that warps the source frame according to a motion field from a reference frame.

From the birds-eye view, the pipeline works like this: first, a set of keypoints is predicted for each of the two frames along with local affine transforms around the keypoints (this was the most confusing part for me, luckily we will cover it in detail later in the post). This information from two frames is combined to predict the motion field that tells where each pixel in the source frame should move to line up with the driving frame along with an occlusion mask that shows the image areas that need to be inpainted. As for the details.

Let’s dive in, and learn, shall we?

[P] Python-FHEz Fully Homomorphically Encrypted Deep Learning Library,"Hey im a PhD in encrypted deep learning and I thought since I have seen a lot of other related posts, about similar technologies I thought I might mention my own Python-FHEz library.

(Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is absolutely amazing if you haven't stumbled upon it yet and are interested in privacy preserving machine learning (PPML) please do go look it up.)

Python-FHEz is specifically an encrypted deep learning library. That is it implements many helpful abstractions like numpy custom containers, so that you can quickly and easily encrypt and use data as if it was in NumPy. Not only this but it implements FHE compatible neural networks/ graphs as standard neural networks in particular activation functions are not abelian compatible/ polynomial operations. FHE requires that only abelian operations are use on it, I.E add and multiply (you can also subtract IF you add a negative number to make it abelian).

You can find Python-FHEz here: [https://gitlab.com/deepcypher/python-fhez](https://gitlab.com/deepcypher/python-fhez)the documentation can be found with Jupyter notebook example (Fashion-MNIST) here: [https://python-fhez.readthedocs.io](https://python-fhez.readthedocs.io)

Now a full disclaimer. I wrote this library, so clearly I am biased towards it. Despite that I feel there are many shortfalls of FHE, and especially FHE bound to python from low level libraries like MS-SEAL (which still has much room for improvement); Space and time complexity are orders of magnitude higher than just normal numpy operations. You also cannot train a neural network while its data is completely encrypted however this is perfect for completely private inference. The reason you cannot train a neural network is two fold. Firstly that would involve encrypting the NN weights, which means even worse time performance as ciphertext-ciphertext operations take much much longer. You also cannot tell when to stop the neural network, as you cannot decrypt the output to tell how well it is performing. You could use some form of proof from the data owner, but IMO it is still a weak argument specifically for FHE model training.

As an aside to solve some of the problems with python+MS-SEAL that I have contended with in Python-FHEz I am also writing a sister library in go, but instead of python+MS-SEAL it will be go+lattigo which I currently call DarkLantern. However this is still nowhere near ready for any form of showcasing. However the dream for this is WASM (WebAssembly) as I can foresee encrypted DL in the browser, with the option to offload the cyphertexts if more hardware is necessary thus Open-Source Encrypted Deep Learning as a Service!

TLDR:

\- I wanted to highlight FHE + DL and how this can be an amazing pairing with some drawbacks that need to be very carefully considered

\- I wanted to showcase Python-FHEz and talk about where things could go with FHE

\- I also wanted to offhand mention DarkLantern and encrypted DL in the browser via WASM!

Let me know what you guys think of these technologies and if you think encrypted deep learning in browser is an interesting prospect!",MachineLearning,1644587376

[D] Relationship Between Function Approximation and Machine Learning,"Lately I have been reading about the history of Approximation Theory. It seems to me that Approximation Theory is generally viewed in two different ways:

Approximating the answers to complex calculations using numerical methods (end result is a number)

Approximating complex functions with simpler functions (end result is a mathematical function)

Regardless of which way is chosen, it seems as though the purpose of Approximation Theory was to originally serve as ""calculators"" for complex problems by reducing them into simpler problems - and in modern times, to limit the behavior of complex functions by reducing them to simpler functions.

For instance, some difficult calculation (e.g. involving exponents with large numbers) can be reduced into a general equation (e.g. x^n), and then methods from Approximation Theory can be used to solve this problem  (e.g. also consider Sterling's Approximation Formula that gives us a simplified formula for approximating factorials and the error associated with the approximation) - or, a high order and multivariate polynomial can be reduced (without significant distortion) into lower order and fewer variable polynomial , and thus making it into a more easier problem.

  As a more modern example, Machine Learning tires to ""approximate"" a simplified function (i.e. machine learning model) from a discrete set of noisy and stochastic measurements -and  these measurements themselves are said to have come from a ""blackbox"" data generating ""function"".

Thus - Is this the essence and original motivation of Approximation Theory? Is Machine Learning essentially Function Approximation?

The issue being that i am getting the following error :

    ValueError: Input 0 of layer ""sequential_17"" is incompatible with the layer: expected shape=(None, 1, 32, 551), found shape=(None, 32, 551)  

This is solved when i am changing the shapes x (test and train) and y(test and train) to include 1 as the second dimension, like this :

[Discussion] Is RETRO inference faster than GPT-3?,"The claim in the [RETRO paper](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/2021/improving-language-models-by-retrieving-from-trillions-of-tokens) is that it has 25x fewer parameters.

[P] Machine Learning Simplified Book,"Hello everyone. My name is Andrew and for several years I've been working on to make the learning path for ML easier. I wrote a manual on machine learning that everyone understands - Machine Learning Simplified Book.

The main purpose of my book is to build **an intuitive understanding** of how algorithms work through basic examples. In order to understand the presented material, it is enough to know basic mathematics and linear algebra.

After reading this book, you will know the basics of supervised learning, understand complex mathematical models, understand the entire pipeline of a typical ML project, and also be able to share your knowledge with colleagues from related industries and with technical professionals.

And for those who find the theoretical part not enough - I supplemented the book with a repository on **GitHub**, which has Python implementation of every method and algorithm that I describe in each chapter.

You can read the book absolutely free at the link below: -&gt; [https://themlsbook.com](https://themlsbook.com/)

I would appreciate it if you recommend my book to those who might be interested in this topic, as well as for any feedback provided. Thanks! (attaching one of the pipelines described in the book).;

"[D] differential equations, RNNs and feedfowards nets"," 

I  am trying to think about the differences in terms of temporal  processing of information between differential equations, RNNs and  feedfowards nets.  Feedforward neural networks pass the data forward  from input to output,  while recurrent networks have a feedback loop  where data can be fed  back into the input at some point before it is  fed forward again for further processing and final output. Differential  equations theoretically improve on RNNs as they capture well the fact  that complex systems are composed of simple components that  self-organize in time.

However, I  am not satisfied with these thoughts and would like to have a more  elegant understanding of these topics? Could you help me?

The data has \~10k rows with \~2000 complete variables but 12 incomplete binary classifiers.  Only 20% of rows have values for all classifiers and around 30% have a value for only 1 classifier.

As I understand it, the source paper handled the missing classifier values by essentially learning ""generating error"" on only known values.  Here is the error function and their snippit from a different version of the same paper (Section 2.2.3).

Idea is to use this domain external knowledge(text form ) over the image scene for better trajectory prediction, as based on rules some trajectory can be prioritized than others. 

One way I can think is to use knowledge graph but they are very restricted, as construction of knowledge graph over the scene at inference time is difficult.

[P] Advice requested - how to solve FinTech data science challenges,"Looking for advice on who to hire and / or what tools would be best to use:

I am building a SaaS company providing a platform for FinTech companies. We have some data science challenges that I want us to build solutions for, which are:

**Data Challenges**

1. Reconciling two datasets against one another to find matches, for example matching invoices to bank statements, where there is uncertainty/fuzziness in the data (no explicit match, amounts and dates may vary etc)
2. Comparing two datasets to look for potential matches between two datasets of customer data, for example comparing known data about customers with the OFAC / HM Treasury sanctions lists to give a probablistic score as to whether a customer is a prohibited person on the sanctions list.
3. Data enrichment, where we take 'messy' data such as a string like '/STARBUCKS 3199/LONDON E12/GBR' and identify that merchant as Starbucks, give it a more recognisable name to consumers (e.g. 'Starbucks'), associate the logo with that merchant, and group that &amp; other Starbucks locations under that common merchant so we can see the aggregate spend at Starbucks.

Additionally I would like these systems to improve over time. I understand we may be able to use tools like Splink + Apache Spark to achieve stuff like this, but we lack the practical experience within the business to know which tools to use or how to implement them to develop this product.

I have a product team in place already to do UX design and developers to code out the solution, and budget to hire 1-3 people to work on developing this solution using either existing tools on the market (software selection &amp; implementation) or directing the build of tools to achieve this, though I suspect we'd be reinventing the wheel if we did.

**Questions**

A. What job titles should I be hiring for?

B. Are these problems/use cases common enough to use the same tool(s) or do they require different approaches?

C. What tools or available software might be suitable so we can look to hire someone with experience using them?

Regardless of what changes I add to my base architecture, such as introducing more dropout, or reducing the number of   layers / embedding sizes, the network consistently over fits once the the training loss arrives in the 0.05 range. 

The validation loss also drops consistently with the train loss until this point of 0.05, upon reaching that point, it hits a lowest loss value, and then starts rising until it levels off at around 0.07. 

While the validation loss levels, the training loss continues to drop and overfits.

Hello!

I've been messing around with YOLOv5 recently, and put together a repo that can be used to build bots for the mobile game Clash Royale :)

[https://github.com/Pbatch/ClashRoyaleBuildABot](https://github.com/Pbatch/ClashRoyaleBuildABot)

The state generator is in a good place, but I'm struggling to build a bot that can climb out of the lower ranks. 

I don't think reinforcement learning will work, as you can't simulate the game locally (no self-play). Even with self-play, I'm not sure you conduct enough episodes on my compute budget! There is a paper ([https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/0631.pdf](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/0631.pdf)) that tries to do it, but it is very limited (Fixed decks and battlefield). They also use a ""simulation environment"" (???), which I assume does not map perfectly to the real game.

A rule-based algorithm could work, but I'm not a good enough player to know what these rules should be.

Does anyone have had ideas/links to literature on solving these sorts of problem? Is the field advanced enough to tackle these sorts of games?

Let me know your thoughts below, especially if you're also a Clash Royale player! Good luck if you decide to try and make a bot :) (Apologies to Mac and Linux users, the code only supports Windows atm)",MachineLearning,1644442722
Different results in production vs evaluation over same period - Keras Deep Learning - [P],"I have built a cryptocurrency regression model but it performs different in real-life then the evaluation over the same period.

I am using exchange binance. In production I call my custom the predict() function each 15min just after the new data sample has closed. Since data is real-time I use the sample at index `-2` because `-1` is real-time and will still change. I also specify the timestamp of the sample I want in the predict() function so there are no mismatches.

I ran the program from 05-02-22 (DD-MM-YY) till 09-02-22 but when I evaluate over the same period it shows very different results: (BTW the model is not trained over this period)

    Real Life:
     * profits: -7.5
     * precision: 0.40
     * trades: 10
    
    Evaluation over the same period:
     * profits: 5.32
     * precision: 0.72
     * trades: 25

So I tested if there was an error in the prediction code. When I call my custom predict() function for each timestamp `[05-02-22 00:00, 05-02-22 15:00, 05-02-22 30:00, ..., 09-02-22 XX:XX]` and then evaluate the results. It is exactly the same as the evaluation results. Therefore I conclude there is no error in the predict() function which causes this.

Does anyone have any idea what could cause this?

This is all the code used in prediction an processing the predictions [https://github.com/vandenberghinc/issue-1](https://github.com/vandenberghinc/issue-1/tree/main). If you read the code you can see that some valid predictions are limited for example if there are multiple possibilites it selects the one where the highest price change is predicted. But without all this limitations it would have made only 13 trades instead of 10. I checked the logs, so that should not be the problem.",MachineLearning,1644440437

"[D] Is neural network architecture just ""alchemy""?","I am trying to understand the ""why"" of neural network architecture. I've been reading papers and looking at winning solutions of big Kaggle competitions that use DNNs. When I look at the architectures they use, it feels completely arbitrary! *This block over here, that block over there! Those two layers have a skip connection! Why?!*

(Below is my opinion of what ML looks like to an outsider who doesn't have inside information - it is most likely incorrect.)

---

On Kaggle, you can get multiple DNN solutions using completely different architectures with varying degrees of complexity - all achieving identical performance.

You'll have a ""Ensemble of 27 63-layer DNN with skip connections and other arbitrary complexity"" that slightly underperforms to ""Simple Autoencoder attached to a simple MLP"". For any NLP competition, you'll have some team that literally downloaded all pre-trained models named ""*bert*"" and used an ensemble of them, and perform identically to someone who did something entirely different.

*If you took the top 20 unique solutions for some competition and polled experts on which ones should perform better - how well would that correlate with actual performance?*

---

Academic papers are similarly confusing. Some papers often feel like authors just threw things at the wall until they found SOTA and then their brains promptly stopped functioning. It's rare to find authors who sincerely try to poke holes in their SOTA result. ML Papers often feel like a ""Dude Perfect"" video with one ""perfect take"" where the authors pretend they totally didn't spend 7 weeks getting failed takes.

The absence of information on what failed makes it very difficult to determine the value of what didn't fail (like undergrads who pester grad students about ""how to get into grad school"" - they don't know, man).

Now, at least in my field (and I'll admit physics is obviously a lot more rigorous than ML is), you do pick up a lot of intuition just by mingling with at conferences - you hear the ""unpublished"" information and develop intuition.

So, I ask you - the experts: Is DNN architecture just alchemy, where people are arbitrarily trying things until they work without knowing why? Or is there a method to this madness? 

*Given a problem statement and dataset, can you ""theory-craft"" an ML system that will at least hit the dart board, if not the bulls-eye on the first try? Can you, a priori, guess which hyperparameters will matter and which ones won't?*",MachineLearning,1644439740

[R]Two Sparsities Are Better Than One: Unlocking the Performance Benefits of Sparse-Sparse Networks - Numenta Dec 2021,"Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13896.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13896.pdf)

Abstract: 

""In principle, sparse neural networks should be significantly more effi-  
cient than traditional dense networks. Neurons in the brain exhibit two types of  
sparsity; they are sparsely interconnected and sparsely active. These two types  
of sparsity, called weight sparsity and activation sparsity, when combined, offer  
the potential to reduce the computational cost of neural networks by two orders  
of magnitude. Despite this potential, today’s neural networks deliver only mod-  
est performance benefits using just weight sparsity, because traditional computing  
hardware cannot efficiently process sparse networks. In this article we introduce  
Complementary Sparsity, a novel technique that significantly improves the per-  
formance of dual sparse networks on existing hardware. We demonstrate that we  
can achieve high performance running weight-sparse networks, and we can mul-  
tiply those speedups by incorporating activation sparsity. Using Complementary  
Sparsity, we show up to 100X improvement in throughput and energy efficiency  
performing inference on FPGAs. We analyze scalability and resource tradeoffs  
for a variety of kernels typical of commercial convolutional networks such as  
ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2. Our results with Complementary Sparsity suggest  
that weight plus activation sparsity can be a potent combination for efficiently  
scaling future AI models. ""

Abstract:

"" More than 70% of cloud computing is paid for but sits idle. A large fraction of  
these idle compute are cheap CPUs with few cores that are not utilized during the  
less busy hours. This paper aims to enable those CPU cycles to train heavyweight  
AI models. Our goal is against mainstream frameworks, which focus on leveraging  
expensive specialized ultra-high bandwidth interconnect to address the commu-  
nication bottleneck in distributed neural network training. This paper presents a  
distributed model-parallel training framework that enables training large neural  
networks on small CPU clusters with low Internet bandwidth. We build upon  
the adaptive sparse training framework introduced by the SLIDE algorithm. By  
carefully deploying sparsity over distributed nodes, we demonstrate several orders  
of magnitude faster model parallel training than Horovod, the main engine behind  
most commercial software. We show that with reduced communication, due to  
sparsity, we can train close to a billion parameter model on simple 4-16 core CPU  
nodes connected by basic low bandwidth interconnect. Moreover, the training time  
is at par with some of the best hardware accelerators. ""

Then I did the vectorizing:

    X_train_vectorized=vect.transform(X_train) X_test_vectorized=vect.transform(X_test)

[N] **CFP:** Special Session on Low-Resource ASR Development @ INTERSPEECH 2022,"# Call for Papers
We invite submission of original results or studies on automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies for low-resource languages to the preliminarily accepted Low-Resource ASR Special Session at INTERSPEECH 2022.

The special session aims to bring together researchers from all sectors working on ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) for low-resource languages and dialects to discuss the state of the art and future directions. It will allow
for fruitful exchanges between participants in low-resource ASR challenges and evaluations and other researchers working on low-resource ASR development.

One such challenge is the OpenASR Challenge series conducted by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in coordination with IARPA’s (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) MATERIAL
(Machine Translation for English Retrieval of Information in Any Language) program. The most recent challenge, OpenASR21, offered an ASR test of 15 low resource languages for conversational telephone speech, with additional data genres and case-sensitive scoring for some of the languages.

Another challenge is the Hindi ASR Challenge that was recently opened to evaluate regional variations of Hindi with the use of spontaneous telephone speech recordings made available by Gram Vaani, a social technology
enterprise company. The regional variations of Hindi, together with spontaneity of speech, natural background, and transcriptions with varying degrees of accuracy due to crowd sourcing make it a unique corpus for automatic recognition of spontaneous telephone speech in low-resource regional variations of Hindi. A 1000 hours audio-only data (no transcription) is also released with this challenge to explore self-supervised training for
such a low-resource framework.

We invite contributions from the OpenASR21 Challenge participants, the MATERIAL performers, the Hindi ASR Challenge participants, and any other researchers with relevant work in the low-resource ASR problem space.

**Topics**

* Reports of results from tests of low-resource ASR, such as (*but not limited to*) the NIST/IARPA OpenASR21 Challenge, IARPA MATERIAL evaluations, and the Hindi ASR Challenge.
* Topics focused on aspects of challenges and solutions in low-resource settings, such as:
    * Zero- or few-shot learning methods
    * Transfer learning techniques
    * Cross-lingual training techniques
    * Use of pretrained models
    * Factors influencing ASR performance (such as dialect, gender, genre, variations in training data amount, or casing)
* Any other topics focused on low-resource ASR challenges and solutions

[D] request | Network architecture visualization tool,"Hi there,

Recently I saw a neural network architecture visualization tool which was really cool somewhere in the last two weeks. I saw it as a demo video/gif either on Linked In (yes, eww) or here on reddit. It was a very modern/sleek looking representation of the network. But I can't find it for the life of me, and now I found a place where I want to apply it.

You could basically build a representation of the architecture of your network in 3D, and you could view it from different angles etc and 'screenshot'  svgs from it for your papers.

The tool basically allowed you to build your neural network layer by layer, I'm not sure whether you would build it through code (LaTeX?) or through a UI though.

One feature I am sure of though, is that it was a true 3D figure that the user could move around to show the best angle, not some faked '3D representation'.

I'm sure at least some of you must have seen this too.

&amp;#x200B;

Please help me find this tool.

[R] Towards understanding deep learning with the natural clustering prior (PhD thesis),"Hello fellow redditors. I'm happy to share my PhD thesis, after 6 years of work. It is relatively short (80 pages), and should be useful to anyone interested in **thought-provoking experiments and intuitions around the training process and inner workings of deep neural networks**. 

I'm open to any questions and feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Long abstract*:

The prior knowledge (a.k.a. *priors*) integrated into the design of a machine learning system strongly influences its generalization abilities. In the specific context of deep learning, some of these priors are poorly understood as they implicitly emerge from the successful heuristics and tentative approximations of biological brains involved in deep learning design. Through the lens of supervised image classification problems, this thesis investigates the implicit integration of a natural clustering prior composed of three statements: (i) natural images exhibit a rich clustered structure, (ii) image classes are composed of multiple clusters and (iii) each cluster contains examples from a single class. The decomposition of classes into multiple clusters implies that supervised deep learning systems could benefit from *unsupervised* clustering to define appropriate decision boundaries. Hence, this thesis attempts to identify implicit clustering abilities, mechanisms and hyperparameters in deep learning systems and evaluate their relevance for explaining the generalization abilities of these systems.

Our study of implicit clustering abilities exploits hierarchical class labels to show that the subclasses (e.g., orchids, poppies, roses, sunflowers, tulips) associated to a class (e.g., flowers) are differentiated in deep neural networks that generalize well, even though only class-level supervision is provided. We then look for clustering mechanisms through the study of neuron-level training dynamics in multilayer perceptrons trained on a synthetic dataset with known clusters. Our experiments reveal a winner-take-most mechanism: training progressively increases the average pre-activation of the most activated clusters of a class and decreases the average pre-activation of the least activated clusters of the same class. Remarkably, this implicit mechanism leads neurons to differentiate some clusters from the same class more strongly than clusters from different classes. These studies indicate the emergence of a neuron-level training process that is critical for implicit clustering to occur. We propose to capture the extent by which the neurons of each layer have been effectively ""trained"" during the global training process through the amount of layer rotation, i.e. the cosine distance between the initial and final flattened weight vectors of each layer. Equipped with tools to monitor and control the amount of layer rotation during training, we demonstrate that this implicit hyperparameter exhibits a consistent relationship with model generalization and training speed. Moreover, we show that the impact of layer rotation on training seems to explain the effect of several explicit hyperparameters such as the learning rate, weight decay, and the use of adaptive gradient methods.

Overall, our work thus provides a collection of experiments to support the relevance of the natural clustering prior for explaining generalization in deep learning. Additionally, it highlights the potential of using explicit clustering algorithms for training deep neural networks, as this would facilitate the integration of natural clustering-related priors into the design of deep learning systems.",MachineLearning,1644407228
[P] What we learned by accelerating by 5X Hugging Face generative language models,"2 trends ongoing in the NLP ecosystem: bigger language model and better text generation. Both are NLP game changers (zero shot, etc.) but they bring their own challenges: how to perform inference with them? At what cost? GPU or CPU ? etc.

That’s what we worked on recently, and below you will find the main lessons learned : 

* memory IO is by far the main perf bottleneck
* Standard API of ONNX Runtime should **not** be used but there is an undocumented way of using another ONNX Runtime API which works well
* Nvidia TensorRT is always the fastest option on GPU, by a large margin
* Caching K/V token representation do not bring any inference optimization (quite unexpected)

Project: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy/](https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy/) 

Notebook (reproduce measures): [https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy/blob/main/demo/generative-model/gpt2.ipynb](https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy/blob/main/demo/generative-model/gpt2.ipynb) 

**1/ Reminder**

Generative text language models like GPT-2 produce text 1 token at a time. The model is auto regressive meaning that each produced token is part of the generation of the next token. There are mainly 2 blocks: the language model itself which outputs big tensors, and the decoding algorithm which consumes those tensors and selects 1 (or more) tokens. 

Keep in mind that these blocks may live on different hardware… (*spoiler*: it’s not a good idea)

https://preview.redd.it/avfgv4s8lsg81.png?width=4441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af8bf51ced5453d4792b9035a4f52b72ab44cfad

**2/ Memory IO is the main performance bottleneck**

Classic approach to make transformer inference 5-10X faster: 

Pytorch -&gt; ONNX -&gt; computation graph simplification -&gt; quantization -&gt; Fast!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o4vowa46lsg81.png?width=6239&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6f1098ec56c8e24f76fb51a12a0826fa48446a7

Sounds cool, but when we tried on GPT-2 with ONNX Runtime we got a model 60% slower than vanilla Pytorch! 

**Why?**

Standard ONNX Runtime API uses numpy tensors for input/output, and for this text generation this is an issue… To generate a single 256 tokens sequence with GPT-2 base, **GPT-2 will output 6Gb of tensors**. For beam search it’s more. Because numpy tensors are stored on host memory (RAM), we are moving 2X 6Gb through the PCIe bus interface and it can’t go well.

ONNX Runtime has a less known API called \`bindingIO\`. It takes/returns pointers to \`ORTValue\`. It’s not documented, but you can also provide pointers to Pytorch tensor storage! Check that these tensors are contiguous in memory or you will lose hours wondering why predictions work randomly 😭

API documentation (but not mentioning Pytorch) : [https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/api/python/api\_summary.html#iobinding](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/api/python/api_summary.html#iobinding) 

There is another trick with this API, you need to allocate memory on GPU for the output tensor *before* starting the inference. Unlike TensorRT, ONNX Runtime has no mechanism to predict output tensor shape regarding a specific input.

**2 strategies**: if an output tensor axis is expected to be the same size as some input axis, just give it the same name. If the rule is more complex, store it as a meta inside the ONNX file (it has a field for it).

some source code to see how to do it: [https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy/blob/main/src/transformer\_deploy/backends/ort\_utils.py](https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy/blob/main/src/transformer_deploy/backends/ort_utils.py)

By taking care of memory IO, ONNX Runtime inference is 3X faster than vanilla Pytorch 😅

TensorRT will push computation graph optimization further, we get 5X faster inference than Pytorch!

**3/ Caching K/V token representations doesn’t make generation faster on GPU**

Hugging Face lib offers the possibility to cache K and V representations of each token to avoid recomputing things and make inference faster for the next token. Does it work?

You may check this very good thread to remind you what is it about: [https://twitter.com/MishaLaskin/status/1479246948637057027](https://twitter.com/MishaLaskin/status/1479246948637057027)

Cache management brings some overhead (concat tensors, copies, etc.). On a fast GPU, recomputing K/V representations on optimized graph is 2X faster than using a cache version (no optimization because it crashes on it)! 

Some explanations:

* cached values represent only a part of self-attention computation, 
* optimized graph transforms self-attention in a single giant matrix multiplication, an op very well optimized,
* Caching a part of the computation breaks those optimizations

**4/ Next steps**

Microsoft has published some work to reduce cache overhead on text generation. It’s definitely something we want to try: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04779.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04779.pdf)

[D] Using Standard Scaler on Sparse PCA (SPCA) - what do you think ?," 

Hi, I am new to SPCA and had a debate with a friend on whether we should use standard scaler (0 mean and 1 variance) on a dataset (e.g., the wine dataset) then we fit the model.

My thinking (based on PCA -*which I am more familiar with*\- not SPCA) was that variance captures/ indicates how much information we have, and if we scale the dataset we will lose that advantage.

Is there any merit to use a Standard Scaler then fit the data? is this something related to SPCA that I do not know? \[D\]",MachineLearning,1644400050

My question is motivated by [

&gt; the backpropagation computation (coming down from the output layer to lower hidden layers) is purely linear, whereas biological neurons interleave linear and non-linear operations,

but this is not expanded upon. Does anyone know:

1) in what sense are ANNs linear? Is it that the layers are always well defined and we move from layer L to layer L-1?

2) in what sense are biological neurons non-linear? Is it the case that for a given pathway certain neurons may not have spiked? I'm assuming there are more cases

Large language models contain extraordinary amounts of world knowledge that can be queried in various ways. But their output format is largely uncontrollable. This paper investigates the VirtualHome environment, which expects a particular set of actions, objects, and verbs to be used. Turns out, with proper techniques and only using pre-trained models (no fine-tuning), one can translate unstructured language model outputs into the structured grammar of the environment. This is potentially very useful anywhere where the models' world knowledge needs to be provided in a particular structured format.

I wanted to reach out to this community since understanding how to implement a curve-shape matching function through dynamic time warping (DTW) seems like it is an essential part for me to understand how I can leverage machine learning for further automated classification of time series data (Even though I realize DTW may not ""technically"" be a form a machine learning).

I have time series data which consists of many lines making up a wide range of curve shapes. These lines start at different time stamps on the x-axis, and so I send all of the lines to individual arrays, recording just their y-axis values, and assuming each observation value occurs at equally spaced time intervals, so essentially having each line as if it started at the same time-stamp. So each of these arrays represents a different line. What I want to do is use dynamic time warping to pair each line together and assign a DTW distance score for the purpose of matching like/similar curve shapes. For instance, if I have two plateau-looking curves from array X and Y, then this pair should be assigned a much lower score than between array X and array Z, where Z would be a wavy-shaped curve. So that is the basic idea. I am using the dtw-python package to carry this out. This is what I have so far, where ""ts1"" and ts2"" are the time series arrays to be compared and ""111"" and ""222"" are just different IDs for the arrays: 

    #Indicate two time series IDs to be compared
    ts1 = '111' 
    ts2 = '222'
    
    #Convert time series curves to arrays
    df_y['ID'] = df_y['ID'].astype(str)
    v = df_y[df_y[""ID""].str.contains(ts1)]
    v = v['Value'].to_numpy()
    
    df_y['ID'] = df_y['ID'].astype(str)
    z = df_y[df_y[""ID""].str.contains(ts2)]
    z = z['Value'].to_numpy()
    
    #Run DTW
    ds = dtw(v,z, keep_internals=True)
    ds.plot(type=""twoway"")
    ds.plot(type=""threeway"")
    print(""DTW Distance Metric:"")
    print(ds.distance)

 and then I see this:

with a DTW score of: 1074.0

And then I try comparing to wavy-shaped curves and receive this:

https://preview.redd.it/3ezzi9mwkog81.png?width=385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3434c3e989e65b343b1d6a72daf2d995b8bd52b6

This receives a DTW score of 16103.0

Ok, this seems reasonable, the plateau shape matches the plateau shape, and the wavy shapes matches the wavy shape. Ok, but what if I am trying to match two wavy-shaped curves with different numbers of oscillations?

And I try this and see:

with a score of 73745.0 (This does not look so good!)

Then I try adding some parameter arguments in the code:

    ds = dtw(v,z, keep_internals=True, 
             window_type=None, 
             open_end=True)

 And then I see this:

with a score of 21365.0 (This is much lower now!)

And then I try:

    ds = dtw(v,z, keep_internals=True, 
             step_pattern=asymmetric, 
             window_type=None, 
             open_end=True)

 And I see: 

https://preview.redd.it/wql334b5log81.png?width=385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa18777447966cca048904387bd478f370dfdbf8

with a score of 12572.0, which is even lower now! I see the last oscillations are ignored, which is interesting, since that might be the approach I am looking for.

And lastly I try:

    ds = dtw(v,z, keep_internals=True, 
             step_pattern=asymmetric, 
             window_type=None, 
             open_end=False, 
             open_begin=True)

 And I see:

with a score of 19227.0, which is now worse than before, and I am a bit confused about what is happening here.

So I wanted to ask whether this looks like I am on the right track with curve shape matching here, but also I wanted to ask what these parameter arguments are actually doing and whether I am using them correctly, since I was really just experimenting with them here. I have had difficulty finding sufficient background and documentation on what these arguments mean from the available documentation for dtw-python: [https://dynamictimewarping.github.io/python/#online-documentation](https://dynamictimewarping.github.io/python/#online-documentation)

What are these arguments actually doing? I am specifically trying to use them to address the issue of two similar looking wavy-shaped curves that I do want to have grouped as similarly shaped, having different numbers of oscillations. Should these extra oscillations be ignored? Maybe just look at the parts of the two curves that actually do largely match? I would really appreciate any insight and feedback on this, thank you!",MachineLearning,1644357536

[N] Experiment tracking with DvC and Guild AI,"I'm the author of [Guild AI](https://guild.ai) (open source experiment tracking). For some time now Guild users have asked for [DvC](https://dvc.org/) support. This is now available [as a pre-release](https://my.guild.ai/t/using-guild-ai-with-dvc/803).

If you're using DvC to manage data sets you may be interested in this integration. You can use Guild to run DvC stages as experiments. Guild's approach to running experiments is quite different from DvC's in that the project code is copied to a new run directory and run there, rather than from your project directory. You can then use Guild's tool set to view, compare, and manage runs.

Parameters and metrics are also integrated. E.g. you can run hyperparameter optimization without code change along this line:

    $ guild run dvc.yaml:train dropout=[0.1:0.4] --trials 20 --optimizer gp

This will run the DvC `train` stage 20 times using different values for the `dropout` parameter (defined in a DvC tracked params file) using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes.

If you're a Guild AI user, you can now define dependencies on DvC managed files using the dvcfile source type.

[D] Best statistical/ ML approach to combine numerically simulated outcome and unstructured data?,"Hello all!

I have been assigned to a research project in collaboration with a manufacturing company who are looking to improve the accuracy of their model. Their research question is to **improve their Finite Element Analysis model (FEA) accuracy with statistical techniques/Machine learning methods.** What they are producing is high-end metal products and they are trying to improve the manufacturing process.

Basically they have raw material with specific properties (strength, weights, etc...) that they are heating at very high temperature and pressure which gives then the final product. The problem is that during the heating phase the product exhibits some shrinkage. **It is this shrinkage that they are trying to model.**

Their engineers have already developed an FEA model but it is not precise enough and is computationally really expensive. They believe that by leveraging the data they have been collecting over the past years (material type, the simulation results and other categorical variables) a hybrid/fusion model could be more precise and give faster predictions. As this is a research question, it does not have to be put into production, they are looking at a prototype framework that could be improve over the years.

I have the following information regarding the first set of data they sent me:

* The data is structured/tabular and contain lots of categorical variables
* The number of points is between 5000-10000 so not enough for a neural network approach.
* They have both the observed outcome (measured in the lab) and numerically simulated outcome (from the FEA).
* I do not have access to the FEA model so no simulation that I can run myself (hence no autoencoder approach to obtain some sort of surrogate model that I could have combine with the tabular data).

My question is then the following: **Given that the dataset is quite small and in a tabular form, is there any statistical methods that can do better than Tree-based models? Has anyone come across a similar problem? Is there any hybrid framework I could use to make the most of the numerically simulated outcome ?**

After days of researching the literature I have not be able to find anything on similar question.

**The idea would be to have the best of both worlds, a prediction constrained by physics-based boundaries while incorporating knowledge from the data to allow predictions in unexplored region due to the strict FEA assumptions.**

The authors create ModelNet40-C, a comprehensive dataset containing 185,100 point clouds from 40 classes, 15 corruption types, and 5  severity levels. The authors also provide a detailed taxonomy of the constructed corruption types. ModelNet40-C is a comprehensive dataset for benchmarking the ***corruption robustness*** of 3D point cloud classification.

Their benchmark and analysis have unveiled that despite the remarkable progress of 3D point cloud recognition models, their robustness against common corruption still requires significant considerations. There is a \~3x performance gap between ModelNet40 and ModelNet40-C.

The confusion matrix averaged from six models also cross-validates that ModelNet40-C still preserve the semantics of the original point clouds.

The authors also conducted in-depth analysis and summarized many useful insights. For example, they show that PointNet achieves strong performance on density corruptions, but fails on transformation corruptions due to its global feature-focusing design. Besides, Transformer-based design is more robust against corruption than others with proper training recipes.

[R] PhD thesis: On Neural Differential Equations!,"[arXiv link here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435)

TL;DR: I've written a ""textbook"" for neural differential equations (NDEs). Includes ordinary/stochastic/controlled/rough diffeqs, for learning physics, time series, generative problems etc. [+ Unpublished material on generalised adjoint methods, symbolic regression, universal approximation, ...]

Hello everyone! I've been posting on this subreddit for a while now, mostly about either tech stacks (JAX vs PyTorch etc.) -- or about ""neural differential equations"", and more generally the places where physics meets machine learning.

If you're interested, then I wanted to share that my doctoral thesis is now available online! Rather than the usual staple-papers-together approach, I decided to go a little further and write a 231-page kind-of-a-textbook.

[If you're curious how this is possible: most (but not all) of the work on NDEs has been on ordinary diffeqs, so that's equivalent to the ""background""/""context"" part of a thesis. Then a lot of the stuff on controlled, stochastic, rough diffeqs is the ""I did this bit"" part of the thesis.]

This includes material on:

- neural ordinary diffeqs: e.g. for learning physical systems, as continuous-time limits of discrete architectures, includes theoretical results on expressibility;
- neural controlled diffeqs: e.g. for modelling functions of time series, handling irregularity;
- neural stochastic diffeqs: e.g. for sampling from complicated high-dimensional stochastic dynamics;
- numerical methods: e.g. the new class of reversible differential equation solvers, or the problem of Brownian reconstruction.

And also includes a bunch of previously-unpublished material -- mostly stuff that was ""half a paper"" in size so I never found a place to put it. Including:

- Neural ODEs can be universal approximators even if their vector fields aren't.
- A general approach to backpropagating through ordinary/stochastic/whatever differential equations, via rough path theory. (Special cases of this -- e.g. Pontryagin's Maximum Principle -- have been floating around for decades.) Also includes some readable meaningful special cases if you're not familiar with rough path theory ;)
- Some new symbolic regression techniques for dynamical systems (joint work with Miles Cranmer) by combining neural differential equations with genetic algorithms (regularised evolution).
- What make effective choices of vector field for neural differential equations; effective choices of interpolations for neural CDEs; other practical stuff like this.

If you've made it this far down the thread, then [here's a sneak preview](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax) of the brand-new accompanying software library, of differential equation solvers in JAX. More about that when I announce it officially next week ;)

To wrap this up! My hope is that this can serve as a reference for the current state-of-the-art in the field of neural differential equations.

[D] Is it fair to compare AlphaCode to human programmers?,"DeepMind's recent AlphaCode paper has triggered some bloated headlines that compare AI to human programmers. To be fair, DeepMind itself doesn't make such claims. Their blog post says it is ""the first time an AI code generation system has reached **a competitive level of performance in programming competitions**.""

Surely, DeepMind has done a terrific job at putting together the right pieces that transform natural language problem descriptions into working programs. And it has been able to compete in Codeforces at an impressive level. But here's the catch: Does ""competitive level of performance in programming competitions"" necessarily mean that AlphaCode can be compared to a human programmer?

I think there's a fundamental problem with such benchmarks and their presentation in the media. Coding challenges are good proxies to evaluate the competency of human programmers. You can expect a human programmer who scores high on Codeforces to have many other skills that are not tested in the competition, such as posing the right questions, thinking about the right problems to solve, evaluating different solution strategies, etc. The same thing can be said about good chess and Go players. Each of these areas requires years of training and practice to learn and master and requires the development of intermediate skills.

ML systems, on the other hand have proven that with data, computing power, and the right algorithms, you can shortcut your way to the end result without acquiring those intermediate skills. AlphaCode is an impressive system that uses Transformers to come up with thousands of potential solutions to a problem and then uses filtering/clustering to choose the most promising solutions. Therefore, it ranks (on average) among the top 54% participants in Codeforces. 

But its approach to solving problems is fundamentally different from those of its human counterparts. Humans don't generate thousands of solutions (just as chess players don't contemplate thousands of potential moves at every turn). They use their intuition to start with a possibly workable solution, and then they gradually test and refine it (or start over if they determine that it is a dead-end).

Bottom line: AlphaCode can be an extremely useful tool to translate well-formed problem statements into solutions. But programming is much more than that.

Hi,

I am new and I wanted to try same as a Youtube video I saw where a dinosaur walks on its own and jumps over obstacle. It only does that, walks continuously, and when an obstacle shows up, it jumps over it.

and I want to improve it by allowing the character (in this case the dinosaur) to run or walk. Do I just add an additional +1 to the output (like if the output was jump or dont jump --&gt; 1 output, now the output is jump / dont jump --&gt; 1 output, walk or run --&gt; 2nd output)? If yes, how do I know which of the 2 output is telling me to walk or run?

like if it's the second one, is it that when 2nd output is &gt; 0.50 it is run and &lt; 0.50 it is walk? or is it &gt; 0.50 is walk and &lt; 0.50 is run?

and how will the dinosaur know that it is currently walking or running? do I add it in as additional input too? because I dont want it to be running, then AI result output says to run again, since it cannot run anymore as it is currently running.

After Googling, I realized that a good way to solve this issue would be to figure out threshold values for each of the classes. How can I figure out the optimal values for the threshold of each class?

Also, Is this way of using thresholds, the standard way of dealing with the sensitivity

&amp;#x200B;

Currently,  the direction in which I am leading is explained below:

I  have used `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy`   Loss while training the model. The model outputs a tensor list as shown below and the label with the maximum value would be the predicted label.

    [array([[-106.15766  ,  -42.931915 ,   -9.968692 ,   -1.6935084,

I don't have much clue about these values getting outputted, except, I know that the label corresponding to the largest value would be the predicted label.

&amp;#x200B;

I ran the model on the validation dataset and collected the maximum value and its corresponding label for each image when a correct prediction is done by the model.

Then I captured the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of the maximum values of labels in the predicted array for each label and the data is as shown below. In the below table each row corresponds to a label.

[D] Deploying Vector Spaces and Nearest Neighbor Search In Production,"## Introduction

Now and then, certain classification tasks may entail the use of the kNN algorithm in vector spaces. With the model training being rather simple and familiar, it is the production that poses many problems for developers.

Further in the article, we describe our attempts to deploy the algorithm for vector spaces, along with the pitfalls encountered and ways to resolve them.

## What is kNN?

The kNN, or k-nearest neighbors, is a classification algorithm based on assessing the similarity between objects. This similarity, in turn, is to be measured as a distance in a given vector space. Hence, the closer an object vector is to representatives of a certain class, the more likely it is to belong to that class.

## What is kNN's biggest advantage over other algorithms?

During production deployment, we might get new classes to predict and we want to start doing so as quickly as possible.

Typically, this requires conventional models to be retrained for each new set of classes. That, unfortunately, can often be too time- and cost-consuming.

To avoid the drawback, we can use kNN-based solutions that are ready to predict new classes as soon as they get a sufficient number of their representatives.

## Applications

Apart from classification tasks, the kNN algorithm can be employed to address other similarity-related problems. These applications include recommender systems (when we need to find the most similar object among existing ones) or fuzzy search (when it's non-exact matches we are looking for).

## Algorithm

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c34e0if2lkg81.png?width=2800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5deb4448b1bad804da8623d1706c50bfdde71169

As we deploy the model in production, the solution of all the above-listed tasks will have two phases:

1. Filling some space with object vectors:
   1. We vectorize the object;
   2. And add it to the space.
2. Determining an object's class:
   1. We vectorize the object;
   2. Find its k nearest neighbors in the vector space;
   3. Analyze the k vectors and their attributes to determine the target value.

Now, there are a few words to be said about vector spaces. While we can build many various types of those, what we need is the one that fits our task better. The structure of such space requires the vectors of same-class objects to be close to each other. The vectors corresponding to objects from different classes, respectively, should be far apart.

Thus, once our kNN is trained, we should end up with:

* A model for further vectorization;
* Distance metric function: cosine distance, Euclidean metric, or any other;
* Final class definition policy: either a simple rule, e.g. return the frequent class, or a complex model that employs multiple statistics to identify the class to be returned.

## Production deployment

https://preview.redd.it/1igouyd4lkg81.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3317386e8a635c07e12ba1d0d5f71c627c03cf20

The deployed solution will incorporate the following components:

* Some abstraction over a vector space for it to be searched and updated (through dynamic addition and removal of vectors);
* Model vectorization service;
* A daemon to load objects, get their vectors from the vectorization service (1), and update the space (2);
* A service to get an object and its vector from vectorization service (3), search the abstraction (4) for its k nearest neighbors, then apply some rule to return the final result.

While we have elaborated a different solution for each of those blocks, at this point we will focus only on implementing the abstraction over a vector space.

## Basic implementation

Here are the basic requirements for the abstraction over a vector space:

* Method for finding k nearest neighbors.
* Method for updating the space, which is greatly important because, without it, we cannot exploit the kNN’s benefits.

There are various libraries (faiss, annoy, nmslib) we can use to handle the above tasks. Deploying these in production means wrapping them either in service for synchronous prediction or in an app that would read objects from one queue and insert the result in another. With the prediction speed significantly important for our tasks, we went for the HTTP API.

An important nuance here is a specific contract employed by many libraries: we pass a vector as an input and get a certain internal identifier as an output. Thus, the searching and updating functions will require us to map (either in memory or database) our objects to internal IDs.

Once that's done, the abstraction can be safely deployed to production, but this is far from over. Pretty soon, you will face new challenges.

## Advanced implementation

**Versioning**

Eventually, you might want to refine the algorithm, say, change the vectorization procedure or the search metrics. For this case, it's always best to keep more than one version in production at the same time. This way, you can quickly downgrade to a previous one if you make a mistake. Another perk is you can conduct a/b-testing. Either way, versioning will be something you have to care about, both of the space itself and the search algorithm.

**Scaling**

Simple and straightforward, the solution works just fine for small vector spaces yet fails miserably when it comes to hundreds of millions of vectors. With vertical scaling’s narrow limits, it's highly advisable to opt for horizontal scaling. This will entail distributing the vectors among shards, sending search queries to all the shards, and then merging the results.

**Filtering**

Some tasks may require searching not the whole vector space, but only a small part of it. Instead of making a lot of smaller vector spaces (which is hard to maintain), you can add filters to the queries to later be applied during the search.

## Vektonn

This article outlines some of the problems we encountered as we deployed our algorithms in production. One last thing we'd like to do is present our Vektonn to the community.

Vektonn's current functionality includes:

* K-nearest neighbor search in vector spaces;
* Vector space dynamic updating;
* Versioning both vector spaces and indices over them;
* Processing hundreds of millions of vectors;
* Search result filtering.

"[D] Classifying Machine Learning Problems as ""P, NP, NP-Hard, NP-Complete, etc."""," In the context of Computer Science and Optimization, I have heard that different problems can be classified using the **""P vs NP"" framework**. Essentially, there is a hierarchy of problems based on the inherent complexity of the problem itself. For example, a problem like ""multiplying numbers"" is considered as ""P"" and is considered fundamentally easier to solve than a problem like ""solving a sudoku"" which is ""NP"". 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v9bk9y3anfg81.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f5d2c3f46bbb04ba43b46b6aa6ef86cfa9d85f9

In most Statistical and Machine Learning Models, there is usually an optimization problem ""nested"" within the model that is required to solve. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Regression Models:** In a standard regression model, we try to find the value of the ""beta coefficients"" that either minimize the error between the (candidate) model's prediction of the response variable and true values of the response variable **(Ordinary Least Squares - OLS)**, or we try to find the ""beta coefficients"" such that probability of reproducing the observed response values is maximized **(Maximum Likelihood Estimation - MLE)**. For simple regression models, there exists ""exact solutions"" to the OLS and MLE optimization problems and we can calculate these ""beta coefficients"" analytically - but in **more sophisticated regression models such as Logistic Regression or Regularized Regression (e.g. LASSO, RIDGE), the corresponding optimization problem is usually solved using some approximate and iterative algorithm such as the ""Newton-Raphson"" Method.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s6zxfbjcnfg81.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=630f7d4b53a55acde5024f134d9338b6dd8e7491

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* **Decision Trees:** A Decision Tree (e.g. CART) is formed by ""splitting"" variables into smaller subsets (i.e. ""nodes"") such that ""purity"" increases in each subsequent subset; ""purity"" is often measured through some sort of ""Information Gain"" that is based on measures such as ""Gini Index"" or ""Entropy"". **Thus, Decision Trees can be interpreted as an optimization problem where ""Information Gain"" has to be optimized.** I have heard that since Decision Trees often have different variable types (e.g. continuous and categorial), **searching for the optimal variable splits that optimize ""Information Gain"" is a Mixed Integer Optimization Problem having an enormous Combinatorial Search Space.** For the interest of creating a decent Decision Tree in a reasonable amount of time, **""Information Gain"" is optimized using a ""Greedy Search Algorithm,"" and as a result, the final Decision Tree (i.e. the answer to this Mixed Integer Optimization Problem) is almost certainly unlikely to be the optimal Decision Tree** (as there is very high probability that a better Decision Tree likely exists in this large Combinatorial Search Space, but finding this Decision Tree would take too much time):

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* **Neural Networks:** Successful Neural Networks are largely attributed to the effectiveness of Optimization Algorithms (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent) to optimize (i.e. determine the ""neuron weights"") notoriously complicated, high dimensional and non-convex Loss Functions:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jx6y8rgnfg81.png?width=1484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e36414f78facad920fb2894f083dd61239e25974

&amp;#x200B;

**My Question:** Is it possible to categorize the optimization problems corresponding to Statistical and Machine Learning Models such as Regression Models, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks as ""P"" vs ""NP, NP-Complete, NP-Hard""?

I am aware that categorizing these problems wont really have any effect on solving them, but I have the following guess: When provided with a candidate solution to any of these optimization problems (e.g. Regression beta coefficients, a particular Decision Tree, Neural Network Weights), we have no real way of checking whether this candidate solution is indeed the optimal solution (unlike a sudoku, in which even for an enormous ""n x n"" sudoku, we can instantly check if a candidate solution violates the rules or not). **Thus, my guess is that many of these above optimization problems are likely either NP-Complete or NP-Hard.**

Is this correct?

**Note:** I have often heard of Machine Learning Optimization Problems being described as ""Ill-Posed Problems"", implying that they are inherently more difficult than ""Well-Posed Problems"" ([https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/433692/why-is-pattern-recognition-often-defined-as-an-ill-posed-problem](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/433692/why-is-pattern-recognition-often-defined-as-an-ill-posed-problem)). This is due to factors such as solutions to these optimization problems ""may not exist"" and ""may not be unique"".

[D] Why Dimensional Modeling is Dying,"At Google, I've noticed that dimensional modeling doesn't exist. Data lakes and bakehouses are common, and star and snowflake schemas are absent.

I believe this is for a few reasons:

3. Clunky to maintain

Does your company still use dimensional modeling? If you were to integrate a new source system today, do you think your company would use a dimensional model, or one big table?

[N] We started a talk series on ML for drug discovery,"Hi all! A few weeks ago we've started a freely accessible talk series on **ML for drug discovery and molecular modeling**. Molecular data is one of those domains for which ML does not quite work yet, but for which it holds a big promise nonetheless. There has been lots of interesting interaction during the first few talks, even more so because professors such as Yoshua Bengio have been consistently attending. Give [our website](https://valence-discovery.github.io/M2D2-meetings/) a look for more information! **The next talk is tomorrow (Tuesday Feb 8) at 10:00 EST** on meta-learning. 

\~\~

*For a bit more context*: I'm writing my Msc. thesis on drug discovery at a company called Valence which is closely integrated with Mila in Montreal. Drug discovery is a multi-disciplinary process that builds upon state-of-the-art knowledge from fields such as biology, chemistry, and computer science. Improving our ability to model molecules and their interactions will have a big impact on not just medicine, but also e.g. fighting climate change. I have been really enjoying it!

Although machine learning holds the promise to improve the efficiency of the drug discovery process, we are not there yet. Compared to other machine learning domains such as computer vision and natural language processing, drug discovery is subject to two particularly challenging conditions:

* **A lower quality and quantity of data**: A machine learning model is only as good as the data it is trained on. In drug discovery, data is limited, expensive, imbalanced and inherently noisy.
* **Out-of-distribution generalization**: With a chemical space that spans an astronomically large number of molecules (estimates range from 10^(20) to 10^(60)), it is unlikely that we will ever have a dataset large enough to accurately represent all of it. It is therefore essential that the models we build are robust enough to generalize out-of-distribution.

Building machine learning models that operate well under these conditions is state-of-the-art research and remains an open question. In this talk series we invited several speakers to discuss how their research tackles these challenges and are discussing topics such as meta-learning, domain generalization, explainable AI, graph neural networks and more.",MachineLearning,1644246097

In my team, we looked into using one a while ago, as sharing info on training runs (and the models themselves) started to be tedious. However, having reviewed a few of them, we decided to stick with our workflow of tensorboard + sharing zipped output directories + sometimes summarizing stuff in sheets etc.

The reasons were mainly (not in any particular order / varying across different tools): the tools being rather expensive, not coping that well with our extensive configuration files, and often being too complex for our use case, resulting in them not adding that much value.

Hence, I am curious what the situation is elsewhere -- if you don't use an experiment tracker and have considered one, why did you decide against it?

[D] Comparing Model Solutions from Saddle Points vs. Local Minimums,"**Can Saddle Points Provide ""Better Solutions"" to Machine Learning Models Compared to Local Minimums?**

The solution to a Machine Learning model (i.e. the final model parameters) are selected by trying to optimize the Loss Function associated with that Machine Learning model. The ""best"" solution (i.e. ""best"" choice of model parameters) are those associated with the ""global minimum"" of this Loss Function (i.e. the smallest value of the Loss Function) - thus, ""relatively better"" solutions can be considered as solutions that are located closer to the ""Global Minimum"". Optimization Algorithms (e.g. Gradient Descent) try to search for the ""Global Minimum"" of the Loss Function by repeatedly searching in the direction of the derivatives corresponding to this Loss Function.

However, there are different obstacles than can occur during this search process. For instance:

* The Optimization Algorithm can get stuck in a ""Local Minimum""
* The Optimization Algorithm can get stuck in a ""Saddle Point""

I have heard ""Saddle Points"" as being considered ""worse"" than ""Local Minimums"" - this is because ""Saddle Points"" aren't actually a minimum of any sort, whereas ""Local Minimums"" are at least minimums at the local level. **Thus, this would imply that model parameters chosen from a ""Saddle Point"" should be worse than model parameters chosen from a ""Local Minimum"".** To further illustrate my question, I drew the following graph of a hypothetical Loss Function for some Machine Learning model:

In the above picture, we can see that Loss Function has a smaller loss at the ""Saddle Point"" compared to the loss at the ""Local Minimum"". T**hus, in this case - (Assuming that we could not reach ""P3"") if we had to choose a selection of model parameters from ""P2"" (""Saddle Point"") and ""P1"" (""Local Minimum"") - it would clearly make more sense to pick model parameters from ""P2"".**

**My Question:** In general, do we know if solutions corresponding to ""Local Minimums"" points on a Loss Function are considered to be ""better"" corresponding to ""Saddle Points"" (e.g. perhaps solutions from ""Local Minimums"" might be more ""stable"")?

Or is this claim incorrect, and solutions corresponding to regions of the Loss Function with lower Loss values are generally ""better"" - regardless of whether they come from a ""Saddle Point"" or a ""Local Minimum""?

[D] Interpretation of Regularization as Constraint Optimization," I have the following question on ""**Regularization vs. Constrained Optimization""** :

In the context of statistical modelling, we are often taught about ""Regularization"" as a method of dealing with the ""Bias-Variance Tradeoff"". When a L1-Norm or L2-Norm Penalty Term is added to the estimation function (corresponding to the statistical model) being optimized, some of the model parameters will either ""shrink"" in size towards 0 - thus producing a ""sparser"" model that is more likely to retain its ""low bias"" but possible reduce its ""high variance"":

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have often heard of functions containing these L1-Norm and L2-Norm ""Penalty Terms"" being referred to as ""optimization constraints"" (i.e. the ""feasible region"" from which valid choices of model parameters can belong to has now been ""altered"" due to these ""norm penalty constraints""):

&amp;#x200B;

**My Question:** **When we estimate some statistical model's parameters and the estimation equation contains some ""regularization penalty term"" - would it be incorrect to refer to this as an example of ""constrained optimization""?** Is regularized optimization in Machine Learning and Statistical Modelling fundamentally any different (with the exception of usually being more difficult and solved using approximate stochastic iterative methods) from Constrained Optimization in Linear Programming?

Where is the field going [D],"I have some thoughts I would like to share.

Machine  learning is about fitting a function to data in order to predict its  value for unseen input. There are many functions that can fit given  data. The one we want is the one that can generalise best. We can  evaluate generalisation ability to some extent on test data. However,  the true function we fundamentally cannot know. It could be any one of  many functions that fit the data we've got, both train and test.

The  vision of the machine learning community is developing learning  algorithms that can generalise well from data to unseen examples. I'm  questioning whether what we're trying to achieve is fundamentally  possible, and I don't see how it could be.

Of  course you can extend Occam's razor and say the true function will be  the smoothest. And I believe much success can be attributed to the fact  you can make this extension in some cases. So is learning the best  smooth function the holy grail and that's what we're working on  perfecting? How are we ever going to tackle general problems i.e. ones  where we don't assume Occam's razor?",MachineLearning,1644194131

"[D] What do you feel about outstanding reviewers receiving ""preferential treatment"" for their own paper submission?","With all the complaints on review quality, one cause is that there isn't really a strong incentive for reviewers to do a great job, especially if they are bombarded with 6 papers to review within a 2 month period, and this repeats 3 times a year. (I think) most people believe that it is somewhat wrong to pay reviewers for their reviews, but obviously the honor of ""outstanding reviewers"" is too little. 

What do you think about the idea of giving outstanding reviewers ""preferential treatment"" for their own paper submissions? Specifically, every conference has many borderline cases, which are resolved in quite ad hoc and random manners. What if we allocate them more heavily toward papers whose authors have been ""outstanding reviewers"" (by some selection mechanism) in the recent past (e.g. for a conference in the past 12 months)? 

Obviously, there needs to be limits: such as the reviewer needs to be first (or last?) author, a reviewer could only ""nominate"" one paper for such consideration per year or conference, etc. This should prevent people just getting an outstanding reviewer involved for this purpose. Obviously, the borderline case resolution should happen at program chair level (or at least senior area chair), where the papers are typically not anonymous. 

I would even argue that given the noise in those borderline cases, it could improve the paper quality. An outstanding reviewer has demonstrated deep critical thoughts on other papers, so it is more likely that their own papers (at least first author ones) would be more likely to be sharper than the average paper, in ways that the (meta-)reviewers may not be able to fully appreciate given the tight reviewing pace.

[D] Using NLP to solve Wordle,"I was watching 3Blue1Brown's video on [The Mathematically Optimal Wordle Strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) wherein they come up with a statistical approach based on Shannon's Entropy to find an effective strategy to solve a wordle puzzle. 

This got me thinking, How could Deep Learning models like BERT or GPT be used to solve a puzzle like this. I am aware that deep learning models might not be the right tool for something like this and there are far more computationally efficient methods out there, but for the sake of discussion how could these very large models be used for something like this.

[Discussion] Implementing late fusion without cross validation,"I am trying to implement Late fusion technique where a classifier is trained for each modality in dataset and a meta classifier is trained on predictions of base classifier. Is the strategy shown in the image below optimal for this purpose? The dataset I have is huge and cross-validation would be very time consuming.  If I get rid of meta-classifier and simply average prediction probability from base classifier, can I simply use original split to train base classifiers?

Also, I used the performed rest of experiments on the original splits. Can the results of late fusion be compared with them given that both are tested on same validation test?

Guessing food names from terrible clues [d],"My wife and I were playing a simple game with a buzzfeed quiz last night and it struck me that it would be difficult to reproduce via ml.



The quiz is straightforward: it gives you 4 potential names for a food, and you pick the correct one. They choices are obvious and meant to be humorous not difficult.



The game we played is less straightforward - one person would read the three wrong names, and the other person had to guess what correct name was.



So for instance, for the first question in the quiz, my wife said ""thunder sticks, daddy's fingers, mouth potatoes"" and I had to guess ""french fries""



While less straightforward than the original game, it's still not difficult for a human. However, it's very abstract, so identifying a training data set is difficult. Even if you came up with a ton of examples, since the answers are derived from nicknames, context and other cues, a broad data set of examples might not be enough to come up with the right answer to a sufficiently abstract question.



Just curious how this community would approach this? Below is a link to the quiz for context.

[D] Improving precision in an unbalanced dataset (Keras DNN),"Hi all,

So say I have a binary classification problem with an unbalanced dataset, where the positive class is about 1/4 as prevalent as the negative class.  I'm using keras, about 500 features, training set has 2.8M neg examples and about 700k pos examples.  Mainly looking at F1 and precision as my metrics.

For training, I use under-sampling to balance the dataset out, so that it becomes about 1.4M examples of balanced data. The validation (and testing) sets I obviously keep unbalanced to represent the true distribution of the data.

During training, I get something like 60% precision on the training data, so 10% over chance (it's a noisy/difficult real world dataset/problem).  For validation/testing, I get in the range of 30-40% precision, depending on what I set my thresholds to.

Other than just to keep parameter searching, gathering more more training data, and possibly engineering some more features, do you have any other advice for how I could further improve the performance of my model? 

I've tried using class weights instead of sampling in the past and generally find that sampling to balance the training set works better for datasets similar to what I have currently.  I've not actually tried over-sampling to balance...just seems like adding extra processing time during training (would be 6M examples vs 1.4M) and I can't see it bumping my precision up any significant amount. Any other ideas?",MachineLearning,1644154181

[D] Unsupervised Brain Models - How does Deep Learning inform Neuroscience? (Interview w/ Patrick Mineault),"[https://youtu.be/vfBAUYpMCTU](https://youtu.be/vfBAUYpMCTU)

Originally, Deep Learning sprang into existence inspired by how the brain processes information, but the two fields have diverged ever since. However, given that deep models can solve many perception tasks with remarkable accuracy, is it possible that we might be able to learn something about how the brain works by inspecting our models? I speak to Patrick Mineault about his blog post ""2021 in review: unsupervised brain models"" and we explore why neuroscientists are taking interest in unsupervised and self-supervised deep neural networks in order to explain how the brain works. We discuss a series of influential papers that have appeared last year, and we go into the more general questions of connecting neuroscience and machine learning.

However, it seems like nowadays, we hear about the KKT Conditions less - for instance, when reading about all the cool things that Deep Neural Networks are doing (e.g. AlphaGO, Protein Folding, Self Driving Cars) , the KKT Conditions never seem to be mentioned that much.

I was wondering if someone could comment on the following:

- Do the KKT Conditions have as much importance in Machine Learning now as they did when they were first developed?

- In general, are the KKT Conditions important in Machine Learning?

[D] Can Stochastic Gradient Descent Converge on Non-Convex Functions?,"As we know, there has been a lot of work and research done to demonstrate that the Gradient Descent Algorithm can converge on (deterministic) convex, differentiable and Lipschitz Continuous functions :

However, I am interested in learning about to what extent convergence of Gradient Descent Based Algorithms (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent) has been studied for (non-deterministic) Non-Convex Functions 

I have been trying to read about this topic over the past few weeks, but the level of math required to understand some of these results goes far beyond my ability to understand. For instance, below are some of the publications that I consulted:

1) ""Stochastic Gradient Descent for Nonconvex Learning without Bounded Gradient Assumptions"" (Lei et al., 2019)

In this paper, the authors comment that:

Stochastic Gradient Descent is being heavily used on Non-Convex Functions, but the theoretical behavior of Stochastic Gradient Descent on Non-Convex Functions is not fully understood (currently only understood for Convex Functions).


Currently, Stochastic Gradient Descent requires imposing a nontrivial assumption on the uniform boundedness of gradients.


The authors establish a theoretical foundation for Stochastic Gradient Descent for Non-Convex Functions where the boundedness assumption can be removed without affecting convergence rates.


The authors establish sufficient conditions for almost sure convergence as well as optimal convergence rates for Stochastic Gradient Descent applied to Non-Convex Functions.



2) ""Stochastic Gradient Descent on Nonconvex Functions with General Noise Models"" (Patel et al 2021)

In this paper, the authors comment that:

Although recent advancements in Stochastic Gradient Descent have been noteworthy, these advancements have nonetheless imposed certain restrictions (e.g., Convexity, Global Lipschitz Continuity etc.) on the functions being optimized.


The authors prove that for general class of Non-Convex Functions, Stochastic Gradient Descent iterates either diverge to infinity or converge to a stationary point with probability one.


The authors make further restrictions and prove that regardless of whether the iterates diverge or remain finite — the norm of the gradient function evaluated at Stochastic Gradient Descent's iterates converges to zero with probability one and in expectation; thus broadening the scope of functions to which Stochastic Gradient Descent can be applied to while maintaining rigorous guarantees of its global behavior.


My Question: Based on some of these publications, have we truly been able to demonstrate that (Stochastic) Gradient Descent has the potential to display similar global convergence properties on Non-Convex Functions, to the same extent at which it had previously displayed only on Convex Functions?

Or have I completely misunderstood the results from this publications, and the conditions (and class of functions) in which the respective authors explored and demonstrated the convergence behavior of Stochastic Gradient Descent is far less ""generous"" compared to those pertaining to Convex Functions - and these conditions are also less likely to manifest themselves in real-world applications : And thus we still have reasons to believe that (Stochastic) Gradient Descent has more difficulties converging on Non-Convex Functions compared to Convex Functions?

Finally, I have decided to put some structure to it and listed the topics in this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WgcHM_I4hqj9yFYIJGYLEz7aIc-KPn4-Mmw_qclYr9g/edit#gid=0). They are from these two sources: [https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/product/](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/product/) and [https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/). It covers things like modelling, data management, testing, production etc..

The ordering of topics is not strict. We can take topics in different order as long as they are coherent and also from both sources to cover the material better.

**Prerequisite:** It's expected that you are comfortable with Python and familiar with basics of ML and DL (for e.g. *not knowing about Transformers is mostly fine but not having trained a CNN before might make things difficult*).

**Schedule:** I will be doing it on alternate days - Tue/Thu/Sat at (8:30 am PST/ 11:30 am EST/ 4.30 pm UTC/ 10:00 pm IST). Each session can be of 1.5 hr - timings are slightly flexible.

If anyone is interested in learning this stuff, please dm or comment here so that I can share the calendar invite.

P.S. The reason for deciding the topics, timings etc. from start is that having these clear significantly increases the chances of doing more than 2 sessions as a group - comes from my past experiences of a small sample size :)",MachineLearning,1644098236
